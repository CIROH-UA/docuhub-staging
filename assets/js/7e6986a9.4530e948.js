This year\'s AGU theme, \\"Where Science Connects Us,\\" aligned with CIROH\'s mission to democratize water modeling and foster community engagement in hydrologic research. Our presentations highlighted how we use containerization, cloud infrastructure, and collaborative frameworks in the world of operational and research hydrology. We also loved connecting with the broader CIROH community through the CIROH Research Exchange (lovingly dubbed T-REX by our talented events team), our biggest exhibit hall booth to date, a very packed poster presentation caravan led by our fearless Steve Burian, Martyn Clark, and Katie van Werkhoven, and, in classic AGU fashion, running into colleagues randomly in the extremely long convention center hallways.\\n\\n## Featured Presentations & Posters by CIROH Science Team & Friends\\n\\n### NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) Ecosystem\\n1. **Advancing Hydrological Modeling: CIROH\u2019s NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) and Enhanced Tools for Community-Driven Research**\\n\\n    Presenter: Bhavya Duvvuri\\n\\n    Session: Poster Presentation H41Q-1427\\n\\n2. **NextGen Research DataStream: Community Contributions Towards Improved Hydrologic Predictions**\\n   \\n    Presenter: Zach Wills\\n\\n    Session: Oral Presentation H31G-03\\n\\n3. **Assessing the use of Physics and AI-Driven Precipitation Forecasts for Streamflow Prediction Using the NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) National Water Model**\\n\\n    Presenter: Jorge Bravo\\n    \\n    Session: Poster Presentation H41Q-1410\\n\\n4. **NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) and DataStream Visualizer: A Containerized Web Application for Interactive Geospatial and Temporal Visualization and Analysis of Hydrologic Model Outputs**\\n    \\n    Presenter: Gio Romero\\n    \\n    Session: Oral Presentation H31G-08\\n\\n5. **Streamlining Community Modeling through Automated Data Processing for the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework**\\n    \\n    Presenter: Sonam Lama\\n   \\n    Session: Poster Presentation IN33B-0380\\n\\n### Cyberinfrastructure\\n\\n1. **Cloud infrastructure for NextGen Water Resources Modeling: CIROH\u2019s R2OHC Cloud Platform**\\n   \\n    Presenter: Harsha Vemula\\n   \\n    Session: Poster Presentation H41Q-1425\\n\\n2. **High-Performance Computing Infrastructure for NextGen Water Resources Modeling: CIROH\'s R2OHC HPC Platform**\\n  \\n    Presenter: Trupesh Patel\\n \\n    Session: Oral Presentation H33J-07\\n\\n### Data Sharing & Community Engagement\\n1. **CIROH DocuHub and Portal: Knowledge Management System for Collaborative Water Resources Research**\\n  \\n    Presenter: Manjila Singh\\n  \\n    Session: Poster Presentation H41Q-1426\\n\\n2. **Demonstrating new tools and frameworks to facilitate continental-scale hydrologic data access and evaluation**\\n \\n    Presenter: Sam Lamont\\n   \\n    Session: Oral Presentation IN42A-04\\n\\n3. **Enabling Community Research with the Next Generation National Water Modeling Framework on through Streamlined Workflows**\\n   \\n    Presenter: Ayman Nassar\\n  \\n    Session: Oral Presentation H31G-07\\n\\n4. **Modernizing HydroShare: Using a Cloud-Native Architecture to Accelerate Water Science Innovation**\\n  \\n    Presenter: Tony Castronova\\n  \\n    Session: Oral Presentation IN42A-02\\n\\n## Reflections from AGU25\\n\\nAGU is a wild world. It\u2019s incredible how you can pack the population of a small town into one convention center and still have room left to spare. It\u2019s even more incredible that at seemingly every turn, we always recognized at least a few citizens of said small town. We had such a wonderful time getting to see old friends and make new ones and come away from each conversation with a new idea for how CIROH Science Team could collaborate with the community. \\nOur team was so encouraged by the number of presentations and posters we saw that used our community resources like our NGIAB container and our high-performance computing cyberinfrastructure offerings like Pantarhei and Wukong. (Perhaps you were one of our 13,101 NGIAB Docker deployments?) Not mentioned in the brief list above are all the presentations we got to see about model developments for the NextGen Framework. We love supporting our member and partner institutions\u2019 research-to-operations work with our cyberinfrastructure resource offerings and community resource repositories like the [Data Preprocessor](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess), [TEEHR](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-teehr), and the [Tethys Visualizer](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-client). We would also love to showcase that work in our NextGen Research Datastream, running every hour for all of CONUS on AWS. If you\u2019ve got a model that you\u2019d like included in NGIAB and/or NRDS, we are more than happy to chat about it (or read through your GitHub issues submitted through our [model integration issue form](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/issues)). We\u2019re excited to get to work this year and support you and all of your R2O dreams!\\n\\n## Community Resources\\nAll AGU25 presentation materials, including posters and slide decks, are available in our GitHub repository: [CIROH-UA/Conferences/AGU25](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Conferences/tree/main/AGU25)\\n\\n## Join the Community and Get Involved\\nDid AGU leave you wanting more from CIROH?

I spent the first week of December at Amazon Web Services\' flagship conference in Las Vegas. The event delivered cutting-edge technical insights, showcased the rapid evolution of cloud computing and AI, and provided countless opportunities to connect with industry leaders.  \\n\\nThe energy across all five conference venues was more vibrant than I ever imagined it would be. \\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## The Central Theme: AI and Agentic AI \\nUnsurprisingly, the hottest topics throughout the conference were AI and Agentic AI. From keynote sessions to hands-on demos, the focus was on real-world applications, responsible AI development, and the next frontier of autonomous systems. Seeing how organizations are leveraging AI to create value sparked new ideas for advancing research infrastructure. \\n\\nHowever, an important reality: security remains paramount. As Agentic AI systems grow more capable, robust security frameworks will be essential to ensure trust and stability. \\n\\n## A Developer and DevOps Paradise \\n<figure style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n  <img src={useBaseUrl(\\"/img/blog/2026-01-aws-reinvent/AWS_blog_pic_0.png\\")} alt=\\"Photos from AWS re:Invent 2025\\" style={{ maxWidth: \\"100%\\" }} />\\n</figure>\\nAs a first-time attendee of AWS re:Invent, I was amazed by the work showcased during this conference! The conference showcased new ways to develop and bring ideas from concept to production-scale prototypes. As AWS CEO Matt Garman said in his keynote: \\"Why not?\\" That spirit of possibility and rapid innovation was there throughout the week. For those who missed it, I highly recommend watching the rapid-fire announcements from Matt\u2019s keynote here: [AWS re:Invent 2025 Keynote](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/?trk=direct).\\n\\nThe keynotes from both the CEO and Dr. Swami Sivasubramanian were insightful. AWS is making strategic moves that are fundamentally changing how we deploy applications on the cloud\u2014making workloads more cost-optimized and efficient. For CIROH, where we manage a hybrid infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms and on-premises, these insights are directly applicable to our ongoing efforts to democratize access to computational resources while managing costs effectively. \\n\\n## Community Connections \\n\\nOne of my favorite experiences was attending the AWS Community Builder Hub. As a member of the AWS Community Builders program, I had the privilege of connecting with others working with AWS. The group was warm, welcoming, and incredibly insightful. Everyone I spoke with shared advice and perspectives that left me feeling both energized and supported. \\n\\nI also got a chance to meet Jason Dunn in person\u2014a great leader in sharing AWS content and community knowledge! These personal connections remind me why community-driven initiatives are so powerful. \\n\\n## Key Takeaways for Research Cyberinfrastructure \\n\\nThe pace of technological advancement is staggering\u2014tasks that once took months can now be completed in days thanks to AI, GenAI, and agent-based systems. But speed brings responsibility: security must scale with innovation. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe conference highlighted several critical areas: \\n- **Cloud cost optimization & Storage innovations**: Check out AWS Graviton5 Processors for HPC Workloads (could be a fit for those hydrological modeling workflows) and Amazon S3 Express One Zone for Research Data  (great for frequently accessed datasets with new cost savings).\\n- **Developer velocity**: Lambda Durable Functions could simplify some of your long-running pipelines, and the new AI-powered workflow design for Step Functions makes building orchestrations much faster. You can use natural language to do this, so it starts to democratize Step Function development. You don\'t need to be a developer to use it.\\n- **DevOps tooling**: CDK Pipelines v2 with AI-Assisted Development has some cool features for infrastructure-as-code that could speed up your deployment cycles.\\n- **Observability**: Amazon CloudWatch AI-Powered Anomaly Detection, especially the cost anomaly detection feature, seems like a must-have for grant-funded budgets\u2014it\'ll alert you when spending patterns deviate unexpectedly. \\n\\nThese developments reinforce CIROH\u2019s hybrid approach\u2014combining cloud scalability, collaborative computing, and on-premises HPC infrastructure-to stay ahead of the curve. \\n\\n## Learn More \\nFor deeper insights into AWS re:Invent 2025 announcements, check out these resources: \\n- [AWS News Blogs: Top annoucements of AWS re:Invent

James took the lead in developing the agenda, lining up the right scientific and\\ntechnical expertise and ensuring that the week targeted the most critical software\\nintegration challenges. Throughout the visit, the RTI and UCalgary teams collaborated\\nclosely with AWI software engineers Quinn Lee, Josh Cunningham, hydrologic scientist Sifan A. Koriche, and James himself. The\\ndays were filled with whiteboards, deep technical conversations, and strategic planning\\naround the future of NextGen water prediction. This recap captures the key themes and\\nthe momentum that carried through the week.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Getting started\\nThe U Calgary team arrived quite late Sunday night. The plane landed around 9:30 p.m.,\\nbut with no dinner on board, the drive from Birmingham to Tuscaloosa became an\\nunexpectedly comprehensive tour of places that were neither open nor in possession of a\\nsingle vegetable. The group checked into the Indigo just before midnight, somewhat\\nhungry but otherwise intact.\\n\\nAfter Team Calgary\u2019s epic late-night journey, we kicked off early on Monday morning with\\na whiteboard session to map out the \u201Cassets\u201D we rely on for hydrologic modeling\u2014datasets,\\nmodels, tools\u2014everything from the CAMELS dataset to TOPMODEL to NOAH-OWP-Modular, plus the\\nassortment of geospatial processing and calibration methods that we all\\ndepend on. The aim was to start corralling this sprawling collection of community\\nresources into something a bit more coherent, mostly because no single group has the\\nexpertise (or the workforce) needed to tackle all the challenges of building state-of-the-art\\nprediction systems. The conversation naturally focused on software integration\u2014the\\nwhole point of the trip\u2014as we tried to figure out how to get these pieces to play nicely with\\neach other.\\n\\nA high point of the morning was meeting with our operational colleagues at the NOAA\\nOffice of Water Prediction\u2014Dr. Fred Ogden, Dr. Fernando Salas, and Dr. Jason Regina. They\\nshared updates on OWP\u2019s vision for future versions of the National Water Model and\\noutlined plans for defining model configurations and calibratng them across the national\\ndomain.\\n\\nRefueled by a terrific lunch at the Curry Kitchen, we reconvened to focus on two key\\nintegration efforts: introducing the SYMFLUENCE integration architecture for large-domain modeling\\nand enabling SUMMA\u2019s process-based simulations to run seamlessly\\nwithin the NextGen workflow.\\n\\nDarri Eythorsson walked the group through SYMFLUENCE, an integration architecture\\ndesigned to make hydrologic modeling workflows more structured and efficient,\\ndescribing how SYMFLUENCE supports everything from defining spatial domains and\\npreparing data to model setup, calibration, optimization, and evaluation. He emphasized\\nthat SYMFLUENCE can also drive simulations from NextGen, giving NextGen access to\\ncapabilities such as large-sample calibration and geospatial preprocessing. Darri noted\\nthat the system runs on laptops, HPC clusters, and cloud-compute platforms, making it\\nadaptable to modeling at different scales.\\n\\nWe closed out Monday with a deep dive into bringing SUMMA into NOAA/OWP\u2019s NextGen\\nframework. The meeting was scheduled late in the day so that Ashley van Beusekom, one\\nof SUMMA\u2019s primary developers, could join from her home in Okinawa, Japan. A couple of\\nyears ago, Ashley added BMI support to SUMMA, making it possible to run the model\\nwithin the NextGen architecture. Ahead of the meeting, she and Darri Eythorsson worked\\ntogether to set up SUMMA as a spatially distributed model in NextGen, and they\\nsuccessfully reproduced the Provo and Oyster River test cases to verify that everything was\\nrunning as intended. Quinn and Josh from AWI were excited by the results and\\nimmediately started weaving SUMMA capabilities into the broader NextGen framework.\\n\\nThe U Calgary crew wrapped up the day on the Indigo Hotel rooftop, sharing giant pretzels,\\nvegetables, and the warm Alabama night air. They toasted the momentum of the visit and\\nthe possibilities ahead. As the night settled in, Team RTI\u2019s Matt Denno and Sam Lamont\\narrived mid-evening Monday, ready to jump into the work the next morning.\\n\\n## Technical deep dives\\nThe RTI and U Calgary teams met up for breakfast on Tuesday morning at Heritage House\\nwhere they exchanged high-fives and consumed the caffeine and carbohydrates needed to\\ntackle another ambitious day of software integration.\\n\\nOnce everyone settled in at AWI, the group dug into the two main challenges of the week:\\nintegrating models into the NextGen framework (the U Calgary effort) and evaluating those\\nsimulations with shared protocols (the RTI focus). The conversation broadened as Arpita Patel (UA), Jordan Laser (Lynker), Zach Wills (Lynker), Nels Frazier (Lynker), Sifan A. Koriche (AWI), Giovanni Romero (Aquaveo), Jonathan Frame (UA), Trupesh Patel (UA), Harsha Vemula (UA) and Manjila Singh (UA) joined to discuss their work on making NextGen accessible and useful to the wider community. Together, the group reviewed progress on SYMFLUENCE,\\nthe NextGen/SUMMA integration, and the TEEHR data model. As always, James Halgren\\nkept everything running seamlessly, turning lunch into a productive working session so\\nthe team could update the University of Alabama\u2019s computer science leads on recent\\nadvances and ongoing challenges.\\n\\nBefore long, the team divided into smaller groups so they could move quickly on the most\\npressing software-integration tasks on the schedule. Throughout the day, the big question\\nhovered: How do we create a seamless pipeline from model execution data ingest\u2192\\nevaluation \u2192 model improvement?\\n\\nOn the RTI side, much of the effort focused on preparing outputs for seamless use within\\nthe TEEHR Evaluation System. This involved translating the output from NextGen\\nsimulations into the TEEHR data schema and determining how best to extract the\\nmetadata needed to track which model configuration produced each forecast. The team\\nalso worked on defining crosswalks to link simulation points to USGS gage IDs, ensuring\\nthat model results could be cleanly tied back to the appropriate metadata and hydrofabric,\\nand they began documenting key operational details such as run intervals and latency\\ncharacteristics of near-real-time runs. By the time the dust settled, the RTI and AWI teams had\\nstitched the pieces together and emerged with the gratifying sense that they had made\\ngood initial progress on the problem they came to solve.\\n\\nOn the U Calgary side, the team split off into two groups. In one corner Darri Eythorsson\\nand Cyril Thebault met with Josh Cunningham to make progress on integrating SUMMA in\\nto NextGen. There were lots of issues to consider, including appropriately linking with\\ndifferent software libraries and ensuring that SUMMA could run effectively in the\\ncontainerized NextGen instantiation \u201CNextGen In a Box\u201D (NGIAB). The software\\nintegration progress was rapid, thanks in large part to the Herculean efforts of Ashley van\\nBeusekom prior to the visit.\\n\\nIn another corner, Martyn Clark sat down with James Halgren, Quinn Lee and Sifan A. Koriche to put\\ntogether a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for the AWI-led efforts to transition CIROH research into\\nNOAA/OWP operations. The timing mattered: James was preparing to drive to Utah the\\nfollowing week for a faculty position at Brigham Young University, and leadership of his\\ngroup was in the process of transitioning to Quinn Lee and Josh Cunningham. The SWOT\\nanalysis brought a sense of optimism and excitement as the team saw the promise in\\nrecent hydrologic prediction advances and brainstormed several clear steps to make the\\nresearch-to-operations path smoother and more effective.\\n\\nLater in the day, Arpita Patel and Matt Denno met with NOAA/OWP Chief Scientist Fred\\nOgden to walk through the latest NextGen Framework design diagram and discuss how\\ntheir development of NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) aligns with NOAA/OWP\u2019s component-based architecture.\\nTheir conversation highlighted that NGIAB already follows many of\\nthese principles, including modular components, stand-alone tools, and fully BMI-compliant model\\nexecution. They also identified clear opportunities to strengthen the\\nalignment, particularly around refining the runtime environment, enhancing component\\ndecoupling, and mapping NGIAB\u2019s architecture onto OWP\u2019s emerging design. The meeting\\nset the stage for ongoing coordination.\\n\\nDinner at the River Caf\xe9 was a highlight of the day. With a table on the terrace and the\\nBlack Warrior River drifting by below, the team enjoyed an evening of easy conversation\\nand good-natured reflection on the progress over the past two days.\\n\\n\\n## A springboard for the future\\nWednesday saw the RTI and U Calgary teams peel off in different directions. RTI paired\\nwith AWI software engineers to advance the TEEHR model evaluation manager, tightening\\nthe evaluation protocols, metadata requirements, and workflow linkages needed for\\nbasin-scale and national-scale verification. U Calgary spent the day with CIROH leadership\\n\u2014Steve Burian, Sagy Cohen, and Erin White\u2014reviewing their major research advances\\nand the steps required to improve the research-to-operations pipeline. A clear highlight of\\nthe day came when SUMMA was successfully integrated into NextGen: Martyn Clark\\nmarked the moment with a celebratory dance\u2014hands clasped, fingers interlocked, and his\\nupper body swaying with unmistakable satisfaction.\\n\\nThat evening, everyone gathered at Steve Burian\u2019s home for a farewell celebration in\\nhonor of James Halgren. Steve and his wife Cindy laid out an extraordinary taco spread,\\nenough to nourish the lively crowd that had gathered to see James off in style. James\\nbrought with him a tall stack of mounted photographs he had taken around the U.S., and\\nhe spent the night offering warm goodbyes and writing personal messages on the back of\\neach one. It was a lovely gesture, and a reminder of how much his enthusiasm and\\nkindness had meant to the community.\\n\\nThe joint visit wrapped up on Thursday morning, when the full team gathered to chart a\\npath forward. Together they mapped out the key components of the NextGen Research\\nData Stream (NRDS\u2014affectionately pronounced \u201Cnerds\u201D) and clarified how NRDS fits\\nwithin the broader NOAA/OWP NextGen framework, including the orchestration manager,\\ncalibration manager, and evaluation manager that had occupied so much attention\\nthroughout the week. The discussion concluded with a clear set of immediate priorities,\\nidentifying the specific steps needed over the next six months to realize near-term\\nsuccesses in the transition of research to operations.\\n\\n\\n## CIROH Cyberinfrastructure: Accelerating Hydrologic Research\\nThis collaborative work exemplifies how CIROH\'s cyberinfrastructure investments are accelerating the pace of hydrologic research. The platforms developed by CIROH\'s DevOps team - the Research to Operations Hydrologic Community (R2OHC) platform and tools developed by CIROH\'s Science team, Lynker team, RTI team and Aquaveo team \u2014including NextGen In A Box (NGIAB), NRDS, and containerized modeling environments\u2014provide researchers with immediate access to computational resources and standardized workflows. By eliminating the traditional barriers of infrastructure setup and configuration, these platforms allow research teams like University of Calgary, RTI International, Lynker, Aquaveo and AWI to focus their energy on scientific innovation rather than technical implementation. This meeting at AWI represents the kind of rapid, collaborative progress that becomes possible when robust cyberinfrastructure removes technical friction from the research process."},{"id":"ciroh-psu-collab","metadata":{"permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/ciroh-psu-collab","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-29-AWI-PSU-Collaboration.mdx","title":"Building Bridges:

a banner year in hydrologic modeling, with advancements in capabilities on both sides of the aisle of CIROH\'s research-to-operations (R2O) pipeline. \\n\\n- From the **research** skunkworks, Penn State\'s [MHPI](https://sites.google.com/view/mhpi/team) group, led by Dr. Chaopeng Shen introduced a new generation of distributed, differentiable hydrologic models spearheaded by [\u03B4HBV 2.0](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR038928). Capable of high-resolution, continental-scale streamflow forecasting across the CONUS Hydrofabric, \u03B4HBV 2.0 fuses process-based modeling and machine learning to enable efficient parameter calibration and interpretable predictions at scale -- with demonstrated viability as a National Water Model 3.0 successor.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n- Meanwhile, from the **operations** core, CIROH\'s Science and Cyberinfrastructure team at the [Alabama Water institute (AWI)](https://awi.ua.edu), headed by Arpita Patel and James Halgren, debuted an operational pipeline composed chiefly of flagships [NextGen In a Box (NGIAB)](https://ngiab.ciroh.org) and the [Next Generation Research Datastream (NRDS)](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/research-datastream/), forming an open-source software stack powering an accessible operational implementation of NOAA\'s Next Generation National Water Model. NRDS, in particular, executes a regularly scheduled set of continental-scale, NextGen-based hydrologic forecasts on CIROH\'s cloud-based cyberinfrastructure, and is designed to be a canvas for showcasing community modeling advances as potential R2O opportunities for NextGen.\\n\\nAs destined in CIROH, these two efforts converged in early October during a week-long collaboration hosted by AWI, bringing Penn State researcher Leo Lonzarich south to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to join in facilitating the formal introduction of differentiable models like \u03B4HBV 2.0 into the NRDS.\\n\\n## Keyboard Accomplishments \u{1F47E}\\n\\nDuring the visit, the CIROH Science and Cyberinfrastructure team worked with Leo to finalize the formal integration of the \u03B4HBV 2.0 model into the NextGen ecosystem. Between extensive code reviews, model refactoring, and validation runs, we verified \u03B4HBV 2.0\'s operations-ready performance through its Basic Model Interface (BMI) within the NextGen runtime, ensuring full compliance with BMI standards and alignment with previously published benchmarks. We enhanced the model to support both batch and sequential timestep simulations \u2014 the latter mirroring the runtime behavior of NextGen \u2014 while maintaining high computational efficiency and reproducibility across environments.\\n\\nOnce \u03B4HBV 2.0 was verified and tuned, we expanded the scope to broader ecosystem integration. The model was finalized on GitHub with modular configuration capabilities, daily and hourly (model coming soon) simulation modes, and confirmed compatibility with the T-route routing component. Significant performance optimizations were implemented to improve scalability across large basin networks. We added \u03B4HBV 2.0 support to the NGIAB distribution, enabling cloud-based state loading from AWS S3 (PR coming soon), and extended its reach into the [NGIAB Data Preprocess](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess) to allow on-demand generation of forcings, static catchment attributes, and model realizations for NextGen. Finally, the static catchment attributes were incorporated into the CIROH Community Hydrofabric, ensuring the model is represented and interoperable within the hydrologic framework used across the consortium.\\n\\nThe beauty of these efforts lies in the fact that \u03B4HBV 2.0 is built upon a model-agnostic, differentiable modeling framework \u2014 [\u03B4MG](https://github.com/mhpi/generic_deltamodel). Therefore, the formalization accomplished during this visit scales to all new research products and advancements made through the framework, streamlining future NGIAB and NRDS integrations and reducing development overhead across projects.\\n\\n## Beyond the Keyboard\\n\\nOut of the office, this week also offered opportunities for cross-team engagement and a deeper look into CIROH\'s computational backbone. In one such case, Leo and the team toured the **University of Alabama\'s data center**, meeting with Josh Lotfi and other members of the **Office of Information Technology (OIT)** who help manage CIROH\'s on-premises high-performance computing resources. Naturally, this included 1-on-1 time with the flashing lights and silicon of Wukong (which supports a bulk of Penn State\'s R&D) and Pantarhei HPCs. Across the board, these interactions gave valuable insight into work going on behind the scenes at AWI and about how CIROH\'s cyberinfrastructure supports researchers and partners across academia, government, and industry.\\n\\nIt is easy to see these collaborations as purely technical exchanges. However, the deep friendships that were built during this visit are at least as important, they inevitably inspire open flows of ideas, mentorship, and future synergies in service of CIROH\'s mission and the broader community.\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\n\\nWith \u03B4HBV 2.0\'s integration near completion, differentiable models will soon be running as part of CIROH\'s NRDS nightly forecasts \u2014 accessible through the NRDS Visualizer where other researchers and community members will be able to explore, assess, and iterate on simulations from this latest crop of hydrologic models in real time.\\n\\nWe anticipate continuing this AWI-Penn State collaboration, with future projects e.g., being additions to NGIAB and NRDS including more differentiable models, a formal hourly \u03B4HBV 2.0 model, and differentiable routing. Some of this work may also arrive in a DevCon to showcase the efforts of both of groups.\\n\\nOverall, this visit exemplifies how CIROH\'s approach to developing a community of practice catalyzes scientific advancements, fosters lasting inter-institutional relationships, and makes normally lab-bound research products salient to the broader R2O community. In these collaborations, CIROH\'s core mission, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and operational forecasting, remains clear and in view.\\n\\nMany thanks are owed to Arpita, James, and the whole of CIROH\'s Science and Cyberinfrastructure team -- `git merge` on research products has never been easier.\\n\\n### Resources for the Curious \\n\\n- [\u03B4HBV 2.0 Operational Model Repository](https://github.com/mhpi/dhbv2)\\n\\n- [\u03B4MG Differentiable Modeling Framework](https://github.com/mhpi/generic_deltamodel) (Backbone for \u03B4HBV 2.0; includes documentation and tutorials for building custom differentiable hydrologic models.)\\n\\n- [MHPI Codebase](https://mhpi.github.io/codes/)\\n\\n### Publication\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Song, Y., Bindas, T., Shen, C., Ji, H., Knoben, W.

Streamflow gages provide necessary measurements but can be difficult and expensive to build and operate. Camera-based monitoring offers a promising, non-contact alternative to or augmentation of traditional streamflow gages. However, broad use of camera-based streamflow monitoring has been limited by operational challenges including how to collect, store, manage, and process the large volume of image and video data produced by monitoring cameras. \\n\\nWith help from Arpita Patel and the CIROH Cyberinfrastructure and DevOps Team, who assisted our team with access to [Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/services/cloudservices/), we developed and tested new cyberinfrastructure that advances camera-based hydrologic monitoring. \\n\\nTraditional dataloggers used in hydrologic monitoring focus on interfacing with conventional sensors (e.g., pressure transducers, float gages, etc.) and lack some capabilities required for camera-based monitoring. Low-cost field computers like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) provide a capable alternative, but lack out-of-the-box software required to support high-resolution image and video capture, management of the large volume of data that accumulates, data processing, and cloud uploading processes. Because of this, we had to build the functionality required to combine low-cost field computers with cloud computing services to produce an operational, real-time, cloud-integrated, camera-based streamflow monitoring system.\\n\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n  <img src={useBaseUrl(\\"/img/blog/2025-09-camera-based-hydrologic-modeling/segmented_image.png\\")} alt=\\"Segmented images by the Hydrocamcompute software\\" style={{ maxWidth: \\"100%\\" }} />\\n  <figcaption><em>Figure 1. Segmented images showing pixels identified as water by the HydrocamCompute software. Quantifying water pixels within the rectangular areas of interest provide an estimate of stream stage and related discharge.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe developed two new Python-based software programs compatible with inexpensive field computers such as Raspberry Pi: one that captures and processes the data from cameras, and one that automatically extracts hydrologically relevant data from image data in the cloud.\\n\\n1. **Hydrocam Collect**: automatically captures images and videos at user-specified intervals, manages local storage on field computers, and uploads captured image and video data to the cloud. Real-time data monitoring and alerts minimize potential for data loss.\\n2. **Hydrocam Compute**: This serverless cloud computing workflow extracts relevant hydrologic data from camera images and videos, such as depth/stage and velocity. Automated and scalable, the workflow can handle a large number of independent monitoring sites, each executing their own serverless functions using isolated cloud resources.\\n\\nIn an operational context, automation is key to a scalable, robust system capable of integrating camera-based monitoring with larger hydrologic monitoring networks such as those managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). We tested the automation of the system we developed using commercial cloud services via Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform with access provided through CIROH. By leveraging CIROH-provided cloud services, our team was able to prototype, test, and scale the software to bridge the gap between proof-of-concept research and practical field use.\\n \\nThis linked software system we developed responds to data events (i.e., capture and upload of an image or video to the cloud) instantly and minimizes human intervention and error correction. The serverless and event driven design of Hydrocam Compute reduces infrastructure management overhead and cost because cloud resources are only used during execution of data processing tasks with no need to manage or maintain physical compute infrastructure. The models used for processing images and video can be swapped out to meet the needs of particular monitoring locations.\\n \\nThe Hydrocam workflows enhance the feasibility, reliability, and efficiency of camera-based streamflow monitoring. As hydrological conditions become more variable, access to high-resolution, real-time data becomes increasingly important for flood forecasting, water resource management, and long-term climate adaptation strategies. This work supports these broader goals in making camera-based monitoring more practical and scalable.\\n \\n---\\n\\n## Resources and Publications\\n\\n### Open Source Software\\n\\nThe [HydrocamCollect](https://github.com/hydrocam/collector) and [HydrocamCompute](https://github.com/hydrocam/serverlesscompute) software programs are available in GitHub repositories within the [hydrocam GitHub Organization](https://github.com/hydrocam).\\n\\n### Publications\\n\\nAccess the pre-prints of papers related to the Hydrocam software and camera-based monitoring:\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Neupane, S., Horsburgh, J.

Through its support for regionalized parameters and models, NOAA-OWP\u2019s Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen framework) offers a potential solution to address these inconsistencies. As such, this study took advantage of NextGen in a Box (NGIAB) to evaluate the NextGen framework\u2019s performance in the MARFC region.\\n\\nThis study evaluated three operational hydrologic modeling frameworks targetted at the National Water Model (NWM): the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS), the NextGen framework, and version 3.0 of the National Water Model itself.\\n- CHPS is the current operational framework used by NOAA\'s River Forecast Centers. It incorporates the SNOW-17 model for snowmelt and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for runoff generation.\\n- For the early phases of this study, the NextGen framework was used with the default model configuration provided by the NGIAB ecosystem, which combines the Noah-OWP-Modular land surface model and the Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) rainfall runoff model [[2]](/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references).\\n  - After initial runs with the baseline configuration, Noah-OWP-Modular was replaced with SNOW-17 output and simplified Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) values from the MARFC database.\\n  - The models were calibrated using two objective functions: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) [[6][7]](/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) [[4][5]](/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references).\\n- The National Water Model 3.0 uses the Noah-MP land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrologic model (WRF-Hydro) [[2][3]](/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references) to simulate hydrological processes across CONUS. \\n\\nThe case studies focused on the Westfield and Elkland basins in North-Central Pennsylvania.\\nThese basins provide good locations for comparison due to the presence of USGS stream gages\\nand their \\"flashy\\" behavior, characterized by rapid and unpredictable rises and falls in streamflow.\\nAdditionally, both Westfield and Elkland were sites of catastrophic flooding during Tropical Storm Debby in 2024,\\nwhich allowed for the models to be evaluated on a recent extreme flood event. Results from Westfield, PA are shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign:\'center\', margin:\'1.5rem 0\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src={useBaseUrl(\\"/img/blog/2025-08-MARFC/fig1.png\\")}\\n    alt=\\"A bar graph titled \'Westfield, PA Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values\'.

Among the calibrated runs, CHPS marginally outperformed NextGen. Additionally, both CHPS and NextGen outperformed NWM 3.0 in Westfield basin.\\n\\nWhen running the NextGen-based models, substitution of SNOW-17 output and simpler PET for the NOAH-OWP reduced calibration time by 50% and produced similar outputs.\\n\\nHowever, the models that performed best during calibration did not necessarily perform best during the Hurricane Debby extreme event.

Focused on the Logan River watershed, this joint effort demonstrated how sharing tools, knowledge, and infrastructure can accelerate both model development and scientific discovery.\\n\\nThrough this engagement, USU researchers gained deeper understanding of the NextGen framework and T-Route modeling library, empowering them to improve physical process representations for the Logan River watershed for heightened simulation fidelity. The collaboration also provided valuable exposure to the developmental side of complex modeling tools, offering insights into framework design, automation workflows, and best practices for model setup and calibration. Both teams benefited from exposure to alternative research tools and methods, which helped enhance and refine the community development pipeline.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOne key outcome was the correction of a spatial representation in the Logan River hydrofabric (Figure 1) using the USU\u2019s specific local knowledge. The reach for this region (highlighted in the zoomed subfigure) was updated to reflect its real world path, where it flows into an underwater tunnel that reconnects to Logan River further downstream. This correction will be integrated into the community hydrofabric, benefiting the wider community by improving model realism and reliability. Furthermore, in combination with freshly calibrated model parameters, these updates have improved the model\'s KGE metric by **0.2 units** \u2014 a significant gain in model accuracy.\\n\\nNGIAB played a central role in this success, streamlining the process of setting up, running, and analyzing multiple model configurations. By removing the typical installation and troubleshooting barriers, researchers could focus their time on advancing physical representations rather than infrastructure issues.\\n\\nThis collaboration sets a precedent for how community-driven, open science efforts can improve hydrologic model performance and usability. By combining localized knowledge with shared national tools, we move closer to creating reliable, reusable, and scalable flood forecasting systems, a crucial step for Research-to-Operations (R2O) success.\\n\\nWe look forward to repeating this model of collaboration with other regional experts and academic institutions to continually refine the National Water Model ecosystem and its supporting frameworks."},{"id":"ngiab-10k","metadata":{"permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/ngiab-10k","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-01-NGIAB-10k.mdx","title":"NGIAB Reaches 10,000 Docker Pulls: NextGen In A Box Makes Water Modeling More Accessible","description":"NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) surpasses 10,000 Docker pulls, highlighting growing global adoption of accessible, containerized water modeling tools.","date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":true,"label":"NGIAB","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/ngiab"},{"inline":true,"label":"NextGen","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/next-gen"},{"inline":true,"label":"CIROH","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/ciroh"},{"inline":true,"label":"Containerization","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/containerization"},{"inline":true,"label":"Water Modeling","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/water-modeling"},{"inline":true,"label":"Docker","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/docker"},{"inline":true,"label":"Hydrology","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/hydrology"},{"inline":true,"label":"Education","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/education"},{"inline":true,"label":"Community Impact","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/community-impact"}],"readingTime":3.23,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita-2023","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NGIAB Reaches 10,000 Docker Pulls: NextGen In A Box Makes Water Modeling More Accessible","description":"NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) surpasses 10,000 Docker pulls, highlighting growing global adoption of accessible, containerized water modeling tools.","slug":"ngiab-10k","authors":["arpita-2023"],"tags":["Blog","NGIAB","NextGen","CIROH","Containerization","Water Modeling","Docker","Hydrology","Education","Community Impact"],"image":"img/blog/2025-08-ngiab-10k/ngiab-banner.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Cross-Institutional Collaboration Enhances Hydrologic Modeling in the Logan River Watershed","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/logan-river-collaboration"},"nextItem":{"title":"CIROH Researchers Showcase Cutting-Edge Hydrologic Science at NHWC 2025","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/nhwc-2025"}},"content":"![NGIAB Banner](/img/blog/2025-08-ngiab-10k/ngiab-banner.png)\\n\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce that **NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)** has surpassed **10,000 Docker pulls** \u2014 a significant milestone reflecting the growing adoption of water modeling tools that are accessible to all.

2025 in Tampa, FL. It was a rewarding experience to learn about the Tethys Platform and how researchers, hydrologists, and geospatial scientists are applying it in their work. Through workshops and technical demonstrations, I gained insights into how this open-source Earth science platform is advancing environmental problem-solving.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOn Day 1, I participated in the **Tethys Dash** workshop led by Corey Krewson, where I learned to build a Tethys dashboard without writing any code. During the hands-on session, I was surprised by how easily I was able to build dashboards using a drag-and-drop interface, as much of the technical implementation was abstracted for simplicity. I also attended the **Tethys Component Apps (ReactPy)** workshop by Shawn Crawley. Unlike the no-code approach of the first session, this workshop focused on building a basic interactive Tethys web app in under 50 lines of Python code.\\n\\nOn Day 2, I also took part in the **Contributing to Tethys Core** workshop led by Nathan Swain. This workshop outlined the steps for first-time contributors to get involved and submit pull requests to the Tethys Core repository. Aside from the workshops, I took part in Tethys App Competition where I presented the Tethys app I developed. It was a great learning experience to understand more about web app developments using Tethys. I ended up winning second place and got a bonsai tree LEGO set!  \\n\\nOverall, it was a very engaging and informative summit. For anyone who missed the session, the workshop materials are available here: [**Talks and Workshop Materials**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18sSPsMkjSRtBZLAClEUV4AetKx9dPS6B)\\n\\n*\u2014 Manjila*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is Tethys?\\n\\n[**Tethys Platform**](https://www.tethysplatform.org) is an open-source, Python-powered framework that lets geoscientists and developers turn complex environmental data and models into browser-based, interactive web GIS apps\u2014without having to become web gurus. Built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), it bundles a full spatial stack ([PostGIS](https://postgis.net), [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org)/[Cesium](https://cesium.com)) plus handy \\"Gizmos\\" for maps, charts, and dashboards, and it integrates seamlessly with scientific libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, and Bokeh. A built-in job manager runs heavy climate or hydrologic models\u2014locally or in the cloud\u2014while APIs make it easy to pull data from THREDDS servers or PostGIS databases. The result is a low-barrier path to custom interfaces, 2D/3D visualizations, and scalable computing that\'s already powering water-resource tools, climate-scenario explorers, and disaster-monitoring apps worldwide. Backed by the [Tethys Geoscience Foundation](https://www.tethysgeoscience.org), the platform\'s active open-source community keeps it evolving to meet new Earth-science challenges.\\n\\n\\n## Community Impact\\n\\nThanks to these capabilities, Tethys Platform is widely adopted in the geoscience community. Scientists around the world use it for a range of applications\u2014water resource management, climate change analysis, natural disaster monitoring, environmental planning, and more. In each case, Tethys helps turn complex datasets and model outputs into accessible tools for decision-makers. As an open-source project under the [**Tethys Geoscience Foundation**](https://www.tethysgeoscience.org), it benefits from an active user community that continually contributes improvements and new features. This collaborative growth ensures the platform keeps pace with emerging needs in Earth science, effectively lowering the barrier for geoscientists to share data and models as powerful web applications.\\n\\n\\n## Tethys Platform Resources\\n\\nTethys Platform offers several resources to help you get started, including comprehensive official documentation, step-by-step tutorials, and a live demo portal. [The official documentation](https://docs.tethysplatform.org) covers everything from installation and \\"Hello World\\" examples to advanced topics and architecture (explaining how the Django backend and various services fit together). For hands-on learning, the [tutorials](https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) guide you through setting up your first app, incorporating spatial data with built-in map layouts, connecting to GeoServer or THREDDS data servers, and even running cloud computations. And if you want to see Tethys in action without installing anything, the [**Tethys Demo Portal**](https://demo.tethysplatform.org/apps) showcases a gallery of live example apps, such as a Gizmo Showcase of interactive widgets and a Wildfire Visualizer that displays wildfire data on a map, giving you a clear idea of the platform\'s capabilities and inspiring ideas for your own geoscientific web applications.\\n\\nEach of these resources will help you dive deeper into the Tethys Platform. Whether you\'re looking to develop a water resources tool, a climate data viewer, or any geoscientific web application, the combination of documentation, tutorials, and live demos will support you on

Analysis](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/72ea9726187e43d7b50a624f2acf591f/).*\\n\\nThe Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) dataset is recognized as a high-value resource for the CUAHSI and CIROH community.\\nThis dataset is hosted by NOAA via Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is available in two primary formats:\\na [latitude-longitude gridded dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nws-aorc/)\\nand the [National Water Model (NWM) projected dataset, part of the NWM Retrospective archive](https://registry.opendata.aws/nwm-archive/).\\nTo enhance accessibility and illustrate analysis capabilities, we developed four user-friendly Jupyter Notebooks that enable data retrieval for both specific points of interest and spatial domains defined by shapefiles:\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n-\\t**AORC_LL_PointRetrieval.ipynb**: For retrieving and aggregating data from the latitude-longitude gridded dataset for a specific point using geographic coordinates.\\n-\\t**AORC_LL_ZoneRetrieval.ipynb**: For retrieving and aggregating data from the latitude-longitude gridded dataset for an area defined by a polygon shapefile.\\n-\\t**AORC_NWMProj_PointRetrieval.ipynb**: For retrieving and aggregating data from the NWM projected dataset for a specific point using geographic coordinates.\\n-\\t**AORC_NWMProj_ZoneRetrieval.ipynb**: For retrieving and aggregating data from the NWM projected dataset for an area defined by a polygon shapefile.\\n\\nThese Jupyter Notebooks, containing instructions and Python code to access the data, enable researchers to retrieve AORC data from AWS.\\nFrom there, the notebooks offer options to subset and aggregate the data over user-defined time intervals (beyond the original hourly resolution) and spatial area.\\nThese serve as examples for how you could write or modify code to access AORC data in your work.\\nThe notebooks are publicly [available on HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/72ea9726187e43d7b50a624f2acf591f/)\\nand are compatible with JupyterHub computing platforms such as [CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub linked to HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2dd1ac86e8854d4fb9fe5fbafaec2b98/).\\n\\nTo use these notebooks, go to the [HydroShare resource](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/72ea9726187e43d7b50a624f2acf591f/),\\nselect \\"Open With\\" at the top right, and choose \\"CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub\\".\\nThis will copy the resource contents (notebooks and data) into the CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub environment,\\nwhere you can open and work through them to access the data.\\nNote that you will need a [CUAHSI HydroShare account](https://www.hydroshare.org) to access \\"Open With\\" in HydroShare,\\nand you will also need to [request CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub access](/docs/services/access/#accessing-ciroh-2i2c-jupyterhub) using a GitHub account. \\n\\nOur work also includes a comparative analysis of the two AORC datasets with a summary of findings.\\nWhile we mostly observed small differences, mainly due to projections, users should be aware of potential discrepancies between the datasets.\\n\\nBy providing these user-friendly tools and highlighting the characteristics of both AORC datasets,\\nour work aims to support and facilitate more efficient hydrological and climate-related research within the CUAHSI and CIROH community.\\n\\n### References:\\n- Salehabadi, H., D.

I-SMART team at the CIROH Developers Conference, held at the University of Vermont in Burlington from May 28 to 30, 2025.*\\n\\nThe densely populated Hackensack River watershed lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area, which spans northern New Jersey and southern New York.\\nAccurate streamflow forecasting within this region is therefore essential to enable effective water resource management, flood prediction, and disaster preparedness.\\n\\nPrecipitation data is critical for effective hydrological modeling, making the identification of reliable data sources a key priority.\\nThis is why the Integrated Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing Technologies Laboratory (I-SMART),\\nan interdisciplinary research unit within the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey,\\nuses the latest developments in both atmospheric and hydrological modeling to address flood risks in the Hackensack Watershed\\nwith solutions that could be expanded to the entire New York City Metropolitan Area.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nIn the past, this work has included key early applications of the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen).\\nNotably, the I-SMART group was among the first to force the NextGen framework with multiple atmospheric models for comparative analysis during a real-world event:\\nthe passage of Superstorm Ida over the New York metropolitan area in September 2021.\\nThe recent advent of NextGen In a Box (NGIAB) has provided an opportunity to accelerate these applications even further\\nby taking full advantage of NGIAB\'s containerized, user-friendly, and easily deployed environment.\\n\\nRecently, the I-SMART team has been testing various regional atmospheric models grounded in physical equations,\\nincluding traditional models like WRF and next-generation atmospheric models such as MPAS.\\nAdditionally, given the increasing popularity and adoption of AI/ML-based approaches,\\nthe team has also begun exploring their potential.\\nThe goal of this work is to assess the performance of these approaches in the Hackensack Watershed,\\nalong with investigating the sensitivity of the model to various meteorological forcings, including forcings based on the National Water Model.\\n*(The initial and/or boundary conditions for all the models were determined using the Global Forecast System.)*\\n\\nThis investigation required handling a large volume of precipitation data from various models,\\neach with different spatial resolutions and in some cases, such as MPAS, using unstructured grids.\\nAs such, one of the key challenges was finding a hydrological modeling framework flexible enough to accommodate such diversity.\\nThis made the NextGen framework a natural choice, allowing them to integrate precipitation forcings from various sources\\nwith the appropriate pre-processing to align them with the model requirements in terms of spatial and temporal scales.\\n\\nThe complex implementation and execution of these models was faciliated by NextGen In A Box (NGIAB),\\nwhich successfully enabled the integration of diverse precipitation sources.\\nBy simplifying local deployment and providing full control over model inputs, configurations, and runtime operations,\\nNGIAB has given the I-SMART team the tools to conduct their groundbreaking research with even greater efficiency."},{"id":"devcon25-infra","metadata":{"permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/devcon25-infra","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-04-DevCon25-Infra.mdx","title":"DevCon 2025: A DevOps

I had the privilege of delivering three oral presentations that showcase the use-inspired science outcomes emerging from the CIROH Science and Technology Team and our partners.\\n\\n#### [1. Advancing Hydrologic Modeling through Community-Driven Development: The NextGen Framework](https://github.com/CIROH-UA)\\n\\nThis [presentation](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1583570&rnd=0.1763265&mode=presInfo) introduced the Community NextGen initiative, a collaborative effort aimed at fostering open innovation and accelerating the framework\'s development. These efforts aim to facilitate efficient research-to-operations (R2O) and operations-to-research (O2R) transitions, ultimately enhancing our ability to model and predict water resources at various scales.\\n\\n#### [2. Enhancing Catchment Based Hydrological Model Performance through Dynamic Sub-Discretization Using Land Surface Attributes](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1583638&mode=presInfo)\\n\\nThis talk addressed how the simplifications in lumped models can lead to reduced accuracy when applied uniformly in catchments with significant land-surface heterogeneity. The study explores the potential to enhance lumped model performance by introducing dynamic discretization based on key land-surface heterogeneities such as land use, soil type and soil layering, slope aspect, and elevation.\\n\\n#### [3. Multi-model Predictions of Design Low Flow Conditions in the Great Salt Lake Basin Using NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1603025&rnd=0.5338731&mode=presInfo)\\n\\nThis research focused on the challenge of accurately estimating low flow conditions in ungauged basins, such as those in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) region. The study paves the way to investigate how different models perform in predicting design low flow, a critical standard for water supply planning, management, and ensuring water quality in the GSL basin at both gauged and ungauged locations.\\n\\nThese works directly reflects the ongoing efforts and use-inspired science outcomes of the\xa0[CIROH\xa0Science and Technology Team and Partners across the consortium](https://ngiab.ciroh.org/#:~:text=Alabama-,Water,-Institute).

That\'s why Song et al. 2024 developed \u03B4HBV2.0, a cutting-edge hydrologic model. It\u2019s built with high-resolution modeling of physics to deliver seamless, highly accurate streamflow simulations, even down to individual sub-basins. It\'s already proven to be a major improvement, performing better than older tools at about 4,000 measurement sites. We also provide a comprehensive 40-year water dataset for ~180,000 river reaches to support this.\\n\\nPenn State research group pushed \u03B4HBV2.0 further, training it with even more detailed river data and integrating other trusted models, aiming to make it a key part of the NextGen national water modeling system (as a potential NWM3.0 successor). But here\u2019s a common hurdle: making powerful scientific tools like this easy and reliable for everyone to use within a larger framework can be tough. Setup issues, runtime errors, and inconsistent results can frustrate users.\\n\\nNGIAB stepped in to solve exactly this problem. Team has taken the complexity out of using the operations-ready models within NextGen by creating one unified, reliable package. Thanks to NGIAB, users don\'t have to worry about tricky setups or whether the model will run correctly. NGIAB ensures that our models are compatible everywhere and, most importantly, that they run exactly as designed, consistently and faithfully, every single time, no babysitting required.

This software allows users to run NextGen in an efficient, relatively painless, and reproducible fashion, increasing community access to the NextGen framework. ngen-datastream is already community accessible (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main) and making an impact on research.  A major component of this software is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based research datastream (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/research_datastream). The research datastream is a CONUS-wide recurring NextGen simulation configured by the community. The terraform to build the AWS infrastructure exists in the ngen-datastream repository and current development focuses on CI/CD and enabling community contribution to the research datastream via edits to the NextGen configuration. Ultimately, these tools help distribute access throughout the community to cutting edge hydrologic research, maximizing the pace of progress of research to operations in hydrology.\\n\\n### Contribution to CIROH: \\n\\n- **Automation**: It automates the process of collecting, formatting, and validating input data for NextGen, streamlining model preparation.\\n- **Flexibility**: It allows users to provide their own input files to run NextGen.\\n- **Scalable Infrastructure**: It utilizes AWS state machine to provide access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources.\\n\\n\\n### Infrastructure Utilized: \\n\\n- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**\\n- **Simple Storage Service (S3)** \\n- **AWS Lamda and Step Functions**\\n\\n\\n## 2.

NextGen is a cutting-edge hydrologic modeling framework that aims to advance the science and practice of hydrology and water resources management. In this month\'s blog, we will highlight some of the recent achievements and developments of the Community NextGen team.\\n{/* truncate */}\\nFirst, we are excited to announce that NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) is now available with Singularity support. This means that you can run NGIAB on any HPC system that does not support Docker, using Singularity containers. Singularity is a popular tool for creating and running portable and reproducible computational environments. To learn how to use NGIAB with Singularity, please visit our GitHub repository: [Ngen-Singularity](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Ngen-Singularity).\\n\\nSecond, we have made several improvements and enhancements to NGIAB, such as updating the sample input data, upgrading the Boost library, adding auto mode run, and supporting geopackage format. You can find more details about these updates on our GitHub repository: [NGIAB-CloudInfra](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra).\\n\\nThird, we would like to share with you is the development of NextGen Datastream, a tool that automates the process of collecting and formatting input data for NextGen, orchestrating the NextGen run through NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), and handling outputs. The NextGen Datastream is a shell script that orchestrates each step in the process, using a configuration file that specifies the data sources, parameters, and options for the NextGen run. The NextGen Datastream can also generate its own internal configs and modify the configuration file as needed. You can find more details and instructions on how to use the NextGen Datastream on our GitHub repository: [ngen-datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/README.md).\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this blog and found it informative and useful. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact us at ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu. Thank you for your interest and support in the Community NextGen project. Stay tuned for more exciting news and developments in the next month. \u{1F60A}\\n\\n[Visit NGIAB News](https://docs.ciroh.org/news)"},{"id":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/NextGen Updates Dec 2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-30-NextGen-Update-Monthly.mdx","title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","date":"2023-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":true,"label":"Monthly Update","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/tags/monthly-update"}],"readingTime":0.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita-2023","page":null},{"name":"Zach Wills","title":"at Lynker","url":"https://github.com/orgs/CIROH-UA/people/ZacharyWills","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60660437?v=4","key":"zach","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - December 2023","description":"News and release notes for NextGen","slug":"NextGen Updates Dec 2023","authors":["arpita-2023","zach"],"tags":["Blog","Monthly Update"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NextGen Monthly News Update - January 2024","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/NextGen Updates Jan 2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"NextGen In A Box v1.1.0 Release","permalink":"/docuhub-staging/blog/NextGen In A Box Release Notes"}},"content":"Happy New Year!!!
