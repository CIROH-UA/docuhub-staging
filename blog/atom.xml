        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="margin-bottom--lg"></div>
<p>The National Weather Service's Middle Atlantic River Forecast Center (MARFC) sees large variations in the performance of the National Water Model 3.0. Through its support for regionalized parameters and models, NOAA-OWP’s Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen framework) offers a potential solution to address these inconsistencies. As such, this study took advantage of NextGen in a Box (NGIAB) to evaluate the NextGen framework’s performance in the MARFC region.</p>
<p>This study evaluated three operational hydrologic modeling frameworks targetted at the National Water Model (NWM): the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS), the NextGen framework, and version 3.0 of the National Water Model itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>CHPS is the current operational framework used by NOAA's River Forecast Centers. It incorporates the SNOW-17 model for snowmelt and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for runoff generation.</li>
<li>For the early phases of this study, the NextGen framework was used with the default model configuration provided by the NGIAB ecosystem, which combines the Noah-OWP-Modular land surface model and the Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) rainfall runoff model <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references">[2]</a>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>After initial runs with the baseline configuration, Noah-OWP-Modular was replaced with SNOW-17 output and simplified Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) values from the MARFC database.</li>
<li>The models were calibrated using two objective functions: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references">[6][7]</a> and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references">[4][5]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The National Water Model 3.0 uses the Noah-MP land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrologic model (WRF-Hydro) <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/blog/nextgen-marfc-performance#references">[2][3]</a> to simulate hydrological processes across CONUS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The case studies focused on the Westfield and Elkland basins in North-Central Pennsylvania.
These basins provide good locations for comparison due to the presence of USGS stream gages
and their "flashy" behavior, characterized by rapid and unpredictable rises and falls in streamflow.
Additionally, both Westfield and Elkland were sites of catastrophic flooding during Tropical Storm Debby in 2024,
which allowed for the models to be evaluated on a recent extreme flood event. Results from Westfield, PA are shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>The simulations executed for the case study are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncalibrated CHPS</strong></li>

<li><strong>Uncalibrated NextGen</strong> (AORC forcings)</li>

<li><strong>Calibrated NextGen</strong> (AORC forcings; calibrated on NSE objective function)</li>
<li><strong>Calibrated NextGen</strong> (MARFC forcings; calibrated on KGE objective function)</li>
<li><strong>National Water Model 3.0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These simulations were executed on the <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/docs/services/external-resources/nsf-access/jetstream">JetStream2</a> platform with the support of the CIROH Research Cyberinfrastructure Team.</p>

<p>The researchers observed that the calibrated runs for both NextGen and CHPS showed significant improvements over uncalibrated runs in both Westfield and Elkland basins. Among the calibrated runs, CHPS marginally outperformed NextGen. Additionally, both CHPS and NextGen outperformed NWM 3.0 in Westfield basin.</p>
<p>When running the NextGen-based models, substitution of SNOW-17 output and simpler PET for the NOAH-OWP reduced calibration time by 50% and produced similar outputs.</p>
<p>However, the models that performed best during calibration did not necessarily perform best during the Hurricane Debby extreme event. This suggests that including a greater number of extreme events in the calibration period is necessary to improve model robustness.</p>

It is important to note that the observed data, denoted by black dots, cuts out halfway through the hydrograph. For this window, peak flow was estimated by the USGS to be just under 20,000 cfs, which is nearly double the second largest event on record.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>NGIAB served as a critical enabler in this study, allowing for rapid iteration and in-depth exploration of the NextGen framework’s configuration space. This evaluation of objective functions, forcing datasets, and baseline models would have been significantly more challenging with traditional workflows.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A joint effort by CIROH (University of Alabama) and Utah State University]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/img/blog/2025-08-Logan-River/fig1.png" alt="A before-and-after comparison of the corrected catchment for the Logan River. Text: 'Correcting hydrofabric by removing catchments that do not drain into gauge'" style="max-width:100%"><figcaption><em>Figure 1. A corrected reach arising from the UA-USU collaboration.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Recent collaboration between researchers in the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) from University of Alabama (UA) and Utah State University (USU) highlighted the value of cross-institutional partnerships in improving community hydrologic modeling. Focused on the Logan River watershed, this joint effort demonstrated how sharing tools, knowledge, and infrastructure can accelerate both model development and scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Through this engagement, USU researchers gained deeper understanding of the NextGen framework and T-Route modeling library, empowering them to improve physical process representations for the Logan River watershed for heightened simulation fidelity. The collaboration also provided valuable exposure to the developmental side of complex modeling tools, offering insights into framework design, automation workflows, and best practices for model setup and calibration. Both teams benefited from exposure to alternative research tools and methods, which helped enhance and refine the community development pipeline.</p>
<p>One key outcome was the correction of a spatial representation in the Logan River hydrofabric (Figure 1) using the USU’s specific local knowledge. The reach for this region (highlighted in the zoomed subfigure) was updated to reflect its real world path, where it flows into an underwater tunnel that reconnects to Logan River further downstream. This correction will be integrated into the community hydrofabric, benefiting the wider community by improving model realism and reliability. Furthermore, in combination with freshly calibrated model parameters, these updates have improved the model's KGE metric by <strong>0.2 units</strong> — a significant gain in model accuracy.</p>
<p>NGIAB played a central role in this success, streamlining the process of setting up, running, and analyzing multiple model configurations. By removing the typical installation and troubleshooting barriers, researchers could focus their time on advancing physical representations rather than infrastructure issues.</p>
<p>This collaboration sets a precedent for how community-driven, open science efforts can improve hydrologic model performance and usability. By combining localized knowledge with shared national tools, we move closer to creating reliable, reusable, and scalable flood forecasting systems, a crucial step for Research-to-Operations (R2O) success.</p>
<p>We look forward to repeating this model of collaboration with other regional experts and academic institutions to continually refine the National Water Model ecosystem and its supporting frameworks.</p>]]></content>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edwin Welles</strong> from Deltares USA kicked things off with insights into a groundbreaking initiative.
The Office of Water Prediction, of the National Weather Service has undertaken an ambitious project to implement and apply a new framework for hydrological modeling: the
The Next Genearation Water Resources Modeling Framework, or the NextGen framework, is designed to emphasize modularity, interoperability, and reproducibility, creating an environment where disparate modeling components can be freely combined to enhance modeling capabilities.
These advantages offer critical support to the National Water Model, alongside other key initiatives such as national Flood Inundation Mapping research.
The system is being implemented by Raytheon with subcontract support from Deltares USA. His presentation provided a summary of the project and envisioned outcomes.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend Tethys Summit 2025 in Tampa, FL. It was a rewarding experience to learn about the Tethys Platform and how researchers, hydrologists, and geospatial scientists are applying it in their work. Through workshops and technical demonstrations, I gained insights into how this open-source Earth science platform is advancing environmental problem-solving.</p>
<p>On Day 1, I participated in the <strong>Tethys Dash</strong> workshop led by Corey Krewson, where I learned to build a Tethys dashboard without writing any code. During the hands-on session, I was surprised by how easily I was able to build dashboards using a drag-and-drop interface, as much of the technical implementation was abstracted for simplicity. I also attended the <strong>Tethys Component Apps (ReactPy)</strong> workshop by Shawn Crawley. Unlike the no-code approach of the first session, this workshop focused on building a basic interactive Tethys web app in under 50 lines of Python code.</p>
<p>On Day 2, I also took part in the <strong>Contributing to Tethys Core</strong> workshop led by Nathan Swain. This workshop outlined the steps for first-time contributors to get involved and submit pull requests to the Tethys Core repository. Aside from the workshops, I took part in Tethys App Competition where I presented the Tethys app I developed. It was a great learning experience to understand more about web app developments using Tethys. I ended up winning second place and got a bonsai tree LEGO set!</p>
<p>Overall, it was a very engaging and informative summit. For anyone who missed the session, the workshop materials are available here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18sSPsMkjSRtBZLAClEUV4AetKx9dPS6B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Talks and Workshop Materials</strong></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) dataset is recognized as a high-value resource for the CUAHSI and CIROH community.
This dataset is hosted by NOAA via Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is available in two primary formats:
a <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nws-aorc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latitude-longitude gridded dataset</a>
and the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/nwm-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Water Model (NWM) projected dataset, part of the NWM Retrospective archive</a>.
To enhance accessibility and illustrate analysis capabilities, we developed four user-friendly Jupyter Notebooks that enable data retrieval for both specific points of interest and spatial domains defined by shapefiles:</p>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>AORC_LL_PointRetrieval.ipynb</strong>: For retrieving and aggregating data from the latitude-longitude gridded dataset for a specific point using geographic coordinates.</li>
<li><strong>AORC_LL_ZoneRetrieval.ipynb</strong>: For retrieving and aggregating data from the latitude-longitude gridded dataset for an area defined by a polygon shapefile.</li>
<li><strong>AORC_NWMProj_PointRetrieval.ipynb</strong>: For retrieving and aggregating data from the NWM projected dataset for a specific point using geographic coordinates.</li>
<li><strong>AORC_NWMProj_ZoneRetrieval.ipynb</strong>: For retrieving and aggregating data from the NWM projected dataset for an area defined by a polygon shapefile.</li>
</ul>
<p>These Jupyter Notebooks, containing instructions and Python code to access the data, enable researchers to retrieve AORC data from AWS.
From there, the notebooks offer options to subset and aggregate the data over user-defined time intervals (beyond the original hourly resolution) and spatial area.
These serve as examples for how you could write or modify code to access AORC data in your work.
The notebooks are publicly <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/72ea9726187e43d7b50a624f2acf591f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on HydroShare</a>
and are compatible with JupyterHub computing platforms such as <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2dd1ac86e8854d4fb9fe5fbafaec2b98/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub linked to HydroShare</a>.</p>
<p>To use these notebooks, go to the <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/72ea9726187e43d7b50a624f2acf591f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HydroShare resource</a>,
select "Open With" at the top right, and choose "CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub".
This will copy the resource contents (notebooks and data) into the CIROH JupyterHub environment,
where you can open and work through them to access the data.
Note that you will need a <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUAHSI HydroShare account</a> to access "Open With" in HydroShare,
and you will also need to <a href="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/docs/services/access/#accessing-ciroh-2i2c-jupyterhub">request CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub access</a> using a GitHub account.</p>
<p>Our work also includes a comparative analysis of the two AORC datasets with a summary of findings.
While we mostly observed small differences, mainly due to projections, users should be aware of potential discrepancies between the datasets.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A poster, titled &amp;quot;Assessing streamflow forecast over the Hackensack River Watershed using physics- and AI-driven weather prediction models&amp;quot;." src="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/assets/images/blog_CIROH_DevCon-bd5de4e3ca6192611aadd30bb47b1586.png" width="1303" height="951" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>

<p><em>A poster presented by the I-SMART team at the CIROH Developers Conference, held at the University of Vermont in Burlington from May 28 to 30, 2025.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The densely populated Hackensack River watershed lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area, which spans northern New Jersey and southern New York.
Accurate streamflow forecasting within this region is therefore essential to enable effective water resource management, flood prediction, and disaster preparedness.</p>
<p>Precipitation data is critical for effective hydrological modeling, making the identification of reliable data sources a key priority.
This is why the Integrated Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing Technologies Laboratory (I-SMART),
an interdisciplinary research unit within the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey,
uses the latest developments in both atmospheric and hydrological modeling to address flood risks in the Hackensack Watershed
with solutions that could be expanded to the entire New York City Metropolitan Area.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>In the past, this work has included key early applications of the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen).
Notably, the I-SMART group was among the first to force the NextGen framework with multiple atmospheric models for comparative analysis during a real-world event:
the passage of Superstorm Ida over the New York metropolitan area in September 2021.
The recent advent of NextGen In a Box (NGIAB) has provided an opportunity to accelerate these applications even further
by taking full advantage of NGIAB's containerized, user-friendly, and easily deployed environment.</p>
<p>Recently, the I-SMART team has been testing various regional atmospheric models grounded in physical equations,
including traditional models like WRF and next-generation atmospheric models such as MPAS.
Additionally, given the increasing popularity and adoption of AI/ML-based approaches,
the team has also begun exploring their potential.
The goal of this work is to assess the performance of these approaches in the Hackensack Watershed,
along with investigating the sensitivity of the model to various meteorological forcings, including forcings based on the National Water Model.
<em>(The initial and/or boundary conditions for all the models were determined using the Global Forecast System.)</em></p>
<p>This investigation required handling a large volume of precipitation data from various models,
each with different spatial resolutions and in some cases, such as MPAS, using unstructured grids.
As such, one of the key challenges was finding a hydrological modeling framework flexible enough to accommodate such diversity.
This made the NextGen framework a natural choice, allowing them to integrate precipitation forcings from various sources
with the appropriate pre-processing to align them with the model requirements in terms of spatial and temporal scales.</p>
<p>The complex implementation and execution of these models was faciliated by NextGen In A Box (NGIAB),
which successfully enabled the integration of diverse precipitation sources.
By simplifying local deployment and providing full control over model inputs, configurations, and runtime operations,
NGIAB has given the I-SMART team the tools to conduct their groundbreaking research with even greater efficiency.</p>]]></content>

<p>This event perfectly demonstrated how DevOps principles—bridging development and operations—combined with cloud computing can transform organizational capabilities. Key takeaways include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automation is Essential</strong>: Pre-event automation allowed us to focus on attendee support rather than infrastructure management.</li>
<li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships Work</strong>: Combining Google Cloud services, AWS services, 2i2c services and NSF's research infrastructure created a best-of-class research workshops solution.</li>
<li><strong>Preparation Prevents Problems</strong>: Our extensive pre-event testing and redundancy planning paid dividends during the live event.</li>
</ol>

<p>The success of DevCon 2025's IT infrastructure demonstrates that large-scale technical events no longer need to be limited by traditional IT constraints. By embracing DevOps practices and leveraging cloud partnerships, we can create learning environments that scale effortlessly while maintaining reliability and performance.</p>
<p>We're proud to have supported the DevCon 2025 community and look forward to applying these lessons to future events. The combination of public research infrastructure, private cloud resources, and dedicated DevOps expertise created an environment where 200+ developers could focus on learning and innovation without worrying about technical barriers.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to co-present a keynote at the CIROH
Developers Conference (DevCon 2025), which attracted over 200 attendees. This
presentation, which I presented alongside Dan Ames, focused on "CIROH HydroInformatics
and Research Cyberinfrastructure." It was a fantastic experience to share insights
into the powerful tools and technologies that CIROH engineers, students, researchers
have been developing to advance hydrological research and operations.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's how NGIAB and Wukong HPC enabled researchers at Pennsylvania State University to create advanced models!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Image of graphical outputs from the δHBV2.0 model" src="http://ciroh.org/docuhub-staging/assets/images/img-e699e9df162042eda9a4a1b4a242ffb1.jpg" width="1966" height="1544" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Predicting water flow with precision across the vast U.S. landscape is a complex challenge. That's why Song et al. 2024 developed δHBV2.0, a cutting-edge hydrologic model. It’s built with high-resolution modeling of physics to deliver seamless, highly accurate streamflow simulations, even down to individual sub-basins. It's already proven to be a major improvement, performing better than older tools at about 4,000 measurement sites. We also provide a comprehensive 40-year water dataset for ~180,000 river reaches to support this.</p>
<p>Penn State research group pushed δHBV2.0 further, training it with even more detailed river data and integrating other trusted models, aiming to make it a key part of the NextGen national water modeling system (as a potential NWM3.0 successor). But here’s a common hurdle: making powerful scientific tools like this easy and reliable for everyone to use within a larger framework can be tough. Setup issues, runtime errors, and inconsistent results can frustrate users.</p>
<p>NGIAB stepped in to solve exactly this problem. Team has taken the complexity out of using the operations-ready models within NextGen by creating one unified, reliable package. Thanks to NGIAB, users don't have to worry about tricky setups or whether the model will run correctly. NGIAB ensures that our models are compatible everywhere and, most importantly, that they run exactly as designed, consistently and faithfully, every single time, no babysitting required. This means users get the full power of our advanced modeling, without the headaches.</p>

<p>CIROH’s cloud computing resources have allowed for the development of ngen-datastream, which automates the process of collecting and formatting input data for NextGen, orchestrating the NextGen run through NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), and handling outputs. This software allows users to run NextGen in an efficient, relatively painless, and reproducible fashion, increasing community access to the NextGen framework. ngen-datastream is already community accessible (<a href="https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main</a>) and making an impact on research.  A major component of this software is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based research datastream (<a href="https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/research_datastream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/research_datastream</a>). The research datastream is a CONUS-wide recurring NextGen simulation configured by the community. The terraform to build the AWS infrastructure exists in the ngen-datastream repository and current development focuses on CI/CD and enabling community contribution to the research datastream via edits to the NextGen configuration. Ultimately, these tools help distribute access throughout the community to cutting edge hydrologic research, maximizing the pace of progress of research to operations in hydrology.</p>
