Through its support for regionalized parameters and models, NOAA-OWP\u2019s Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen framework) offers a potential solution to address these inconsistencies. As such, this study took advantage of NextGen in a Box (NGIAB) to evaluate the NextGen framework\u2019s performance in the MARFC region.\\n\\nThis study evaluated three operational hydrologic modeling frameworks targetted at the National Water Model (NWM): the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS), the NextGen framework, and version 3.0 of the National Water Model itself.\\n- CHPS is the current operational framework used by NOAA\'s River Forecast Centers. It incorporates the SNOW-17 model for snowmelt and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for runoff generation.\\n- For the early phases of this study, the NextGen framework was used with the default model configuration provided by the NGIAB ecosystem, which combines the Noah-OWP-Modular land surface model and the Conceptual Functional Equivalent (CFE) rainfall runoff model [[2]](#references).\\n  - After initial runs with the baseline configuration, Noah-OWP-Modular was replaced with SNOW-17 output and simplified Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) values from the MARFC database.\\n  - The models were calibrated using two objective functions: Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) [[6][7]](#references) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) [[4][5]](#references).\\n- The National Water Model 3.0 uses the Noah-MP land surface model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrologic model (WRF-Hydro) [[2][3]](#references) to simulate hydrological processes across CONUS. \\n\\nThe case studies focused on the Westfield and Elkland basins in North-Central Pennsylvania.\\nThese basins provide good locations for comparison due to the presence of USGS stream gages\\nand their \\"flashy\\" behavior, characterized by rapid and unpredictable rises and falls in streamflow.\\nAdditionally, both Westfield and Elkland were sites of catastrophic flooding during Tropical Storm Debby in 2024,\\nwhich allowed for the models to be evaluated on a recent extreme flood event. Results from Westfield, PA are shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign:\'center\', margin:\'1.5rem 0\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src={useBaseUrl(\\"/img/blog/2025-08-MARFC/fig1.png\\")}\\n    alt=\\"A bar graph titled \'Westfield, PA Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values\'.

Among the calibrated runs, CHPS marginally outperformed NextGen. Additionally, both CHPS and NextGen outperformed NWM 3.0 in Westfield basin.\\n\\nWhen running the NextGen-based models, substitution of SNOW-17 output and simpler PET for the NOAH-OWP reduced calibration time by 50% and produced similar outputs.\\n\\nHowever, the models that performed best during calibration did not necessarily perform best during the Hurricane Debby extreme event. This suggests that including a greater number of extreme events in the calibration period is necessary to improve model robustness.\\n\\n<figure style={{ textAlign:\'center\', margin:\'1.5rem 0\' }}>\\n  <img\\n    src={useBaseUrl(\\"/img/blog/2025-08-MARFC/fig3.png\\")}\\n    alt=\\"A hydrograph depicting streamflow observations and outputs for Tropical Storm Debby on 08/09/2024.\\"\\n    style={{ maxWidth:\'100%\', height:\'auto\' }}\\n  />\\n  <figcaption style={{ fontSize:\'0.95rem\', lineHeight:1.6, marginTop:\'0.6rem\', opacity:0.9 }}>\\n    **Figure 3**) Hydrograph of Tropical Storm Debby on 08/09/2024.

A corrected reach arising from the UA-USU collaboration.</em></figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nRecent collaboration between researchers in the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) from University of Alabama (UA) and Utah State University (USU) highlighted the value of cross-institutional partnerships in improving community hydrologic modeling. Focused on the Logan River watershed, this joint effort demonstrated how sharing tools, knowledge, and infrastructure can accelerate both model development and scientific discovery.\\n\\nThrough this engagement, USU researchers gained deeper understanding of the NextGen framework and T-Route modeling library, empowering them to improve physical process representations for the Logan River watershed for heightened simulation fidelity. The collaboration also provided valuable exposure to the developmental side of complex modeling tools, offering insights into framework design, automation workflows, and best practices for model setup and calibration. Both teams benefited from exposure to alternative research tools and methods, which helped enhance and refine the community development pipeline.\\n\\nOne key outcome was the correction of a spatial representation in the Logan River hydrofabric (Figure 1) using the USU\u2019s specific local knowledge. The reach for this region (highlighted in the zoomed subfigure) was updated to reflect its real world path, where it flows into an underwater tunnel that reconnects to Logan River further downstream. This correction will be integrated into the community hydrofabric, benefiting the wider community by improving model realism and reliability. Furthermore, in combination with freshly calibrated model parameters, these updates have improved the model\'s KGE metric by **0.2 units** \u2014 a significant gain in model accuracy.\\n\\nNGIAB played a central role in this success, streamlining the process of setting up, running, and analyzing multiple model configurations. By removing the typical installation and troubleshooting barriers, researchers could focus their time on advancing physical representations rather than infrastructure issues.\\n\\nThis collaboration sets a precedent for how community-driven, open science efforts can improve hydrologic model performance and usability. By combining localized knowledge with shared national tools, we move closer to creating reliable, reusable, and scalable flood forecasting systems, a crucial step for Research-to-Operations (R2O) success.\\n\\nWe look forward to repeating this model of collaboration with other regional experts and academic institutions to continually refine the National Water Model ecosystem and its supporting frameworks."},{"id":"ngiab-10k","metadata":{"permalink":"/local/blog/ngiab-10k","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-01-NGIAB-10k.mdx","title":"NGIAB Reaches 10,000 Docker Pulls: NextGen In A Box Makes Water Modeling More Accessible","description":"NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) surpasses 10,000 Docker pulls, highlighting growing global adoption of accessible, containerized water modeling tools.","date":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":true,"label":"NGIAB","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ngiab"},{"inline":true,"label":"CIROH","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ciroh"},{"inline":true,"label":"Containerization","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/containerization"},{"inline":true,"label":"Water Modeling","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/water-modeling"},{"inline":true,"label":"Docker","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/docker"},{"inline":true,"label":"Hydrology","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/hydrology"},{"inline":true,"label":"Education","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/education"},{"inline":true,"label":"Community Impact","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/community-impact"}],"readingTime":3.23,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NGIAB Reaches 10,000 Docker Pulls: NextGen In A Box Makes Water Modeling More Accessible","description":"NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) surpasses 10,000 Docker pulls, highlighting growing global adoption of accessible, containerized water modeling tools.","slug":"ngiab-10k","authors":["arpita"],"tags":["Blog","NGIAB","CIROH","Containerization","Water Modeling","Docker","Hydrology","Education","Community Impact"],"image":"/img/blog/2025-08-ngiab-10k/ngiab-banner.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Cross-Institutional Collaboration Enhances Hydrologic Modeling in the Logan River Watershed","permalink":"/local/blog/logan-river-collaboration"},"nextItem":{"title":"CIROH Researchers Showcase Cutting-Edge Hydrologic Science at NHWC 2025","permalink":"/local/blog/nhwc-2025"}},"content":"![NGIAB Banner](/img/blog/2025-08-ngiab-10k/ngiab-banner.png)\\n\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce that **NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)** has surpassed **10,000 Docker pulls** \u2014 a significant milestone reflecting the growing adoption of water modeling tools that are accessible to all.

2025 in Tampa, FL. It was a rewarding experience to learn about the Tethys Platform and how researchers, hydrologists, and geospatial scientists are applying it in their work. Through workshops and technical demonstrations, I gained insights into how this open-source Earth science platform is advancing environmental problem-solving.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOn Day 1, I participated in the **Tethys Dash** workshop led by Corey Krewson, where I learned to build a Tethys dashboard without writing any code. During the hands-on session, I was surprised by how easily I was able to build dashboards using a drag-and-drop interface, as much of the technical implementation was abstracted for simplicity. I also attended the **Tethys Component Apps (ReactPy)** workshop by Shawn Crawley. Unlike the no-code approach of the first session, this workshop focused on building a basic interactive Tethys web app in under 50 lines of Python code.\\n\\nOn Day 2, I also took part in the **Contributing to Tethys Core** workshop led by Nathan Swain. This workshop outlined the steps for first-time contributors to get involved and submit pull requests to the Tethys Core repository. Aside from the workshops, I took part in Tethys App Competition where I presented the Tethys app I developed. It was a great learning experience to understand more about web app developments using Tethys. I ended up winning second place and got a bonsai tree LEGO set!  \\n\\nOverall, it was a very engaging and informative summit. For anyone who missed the session, the workshop materials are available here: [**Talks and Workshop Materials**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18sSPsMkjSRtBZLAClEUV4AetKx9dPS6B)\\n\\n*\u2014 Manjila*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is Tethys?\\n\\n[**Tethys Platform**](https://www.tethysplatform.org) is an open-source, Python-powered framework that lets geoscientists and developers turn complex environmental data and models into browser-based, interactive web GIS apps\u2014without having to become web gurus. Built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), it bundles a full spatial stack ([PostGIS](https://postgis.net), [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org), [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org)/[Cesium](https://cesium.com)) plus handy \\"Gizmos\\" for maps, charts, and dashboards, and it integrates seamlessly with scientific libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, and Bokeh. A built-in job manager runs heavy climate or hydrologic models\u2014locally or in the cloud\u2014while APIs make it easy to pull data from THREDDS servers or PostGIS databases. The result is a low-barrier path to custom interfaces, 2D/3D visualizations, and scalable computing that\'s already powering water-resource tools, climate-scenario explorers, and disaster-monitoring apps worldwide. Backed by the [Tethys Geoscience Foundation](https://www.tethysgeoscience.org), the platform\'s active open-source community keeps it evolving to meet new Earth-science challenges.\\n\\n\\n## Community Impact\\n\\nThanks to these capabilities, Tethys Platform is widely adopted in the geoscience community. Scientists around the world use it for a range of applications\u2014water resource management, climate change analysis, natural disaster monitoring, environmental planning, and more. In each case, Tethys helps turn complex datasets and model outputs into accessible tools for decision-makers. As an open-source project under the [**Tethys Geoscience Foundation**](https://www.tethysgeoscience.org), it benefits from an active user community that continually contributes improvements and new features. This collaborative growth ensures the platform keeps pace with emerging needs in Earth science, effectively lowering the barrier for geoscientists to share data and models as powerful web applications.\\n\\n\\n## Tethys Platform Resources\\n\\nTethys Platform offers several resources to help you get started, including comprehensive official documentation, step-by-step tutorials, and a live demo portal. [The official documentation](https://docs.tethysplatform.org) covers everything from installation and \\"Hello World\\" examples to advanced topics and architecture (explaining how the Django backend and various services fit together). For hands-on learning, the [tutorials](https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) guide you through setting up your first app, incorporating spatial data with built-in map layouts, connecting to GeoServer or THREDDS data servers, and even running cloud computations. And if you want to see Tethys in action without installing anything, the [**Tethys Demo Portal**](https://demo.tethysplatform.org/apps) showcases a gallery of live example apps, such as a Gizmo Showcase of interactive widgets and a Wildfire Visualizer that displays wildfire data on a map, giving you a clear idea of the platform\'s capabilities and inspiring ideas for your own geoscientific web applications.\\n\\nEach of these resources will help you dive deeper into the Tethys Platform. Whether you\'re looking to develop a water resources tool, a climate data viewer, or any geoscientific web application, the combination of documentation, tutorials, and live demos will support you on your journey with Tethys. **Happy app building!**\\n\\n*\u2014

physics- and AI-driven weather prediction models\\".](/img/blog/2025-06-27-ngiab-based-research/blog_CIROH_DevCon.png)\\n</div>\\n> *A poster presented by the I-SMART team at the CIROH Developers Conference, held at the University of Vermont in Burlington from May 28 to 30, 2025.*\\n\\nThe densely populated Hackensack River watershed lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area, which spans northern New Jersey and southern New York.\\nAccurate streamflow forecasting within this region is therefore essential to enable effective water resource management, flood prediction, and disaster preparedness.\\n\\nPrecipitation data is critical for effective hydrological modeling, making the identification of reliable data sources a key priority.\\nThis is why the Integrated Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing Technologies Laboratory (I-SMART),\\nan interdisciplinary research unit within the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey,\\nuses the latest developments in both atmospheric and hydrological modeling to address flood risks in the Hackensack Watershed\\nwith solutions that could be expanded to the entire New York City Metropolitan Area.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nIn the past, this work has included key early applications of the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen).\\nNotably, the I-SMART group was among the first to force the NextGen framework with multiple atmospheric models for comparative analysis during a real-world event:\\nthe passage of Superstorm Ida over the New York metropolitan area in September 2021.\\nThe recent advent of NextGen In a Box (NGIAB) has provided an opportunity to accelerate these applications even further\\nby taking full advantage of NGIAB\'s containerized, user-friendly, and easily deployed environment.\\n\\nRecently, the I-SMART team has been testing various regional atmospheric models grounded in physical equations,\\nincluding traditional models like WRF and next-generation atmospheric models such as MPAS.\\nAdditionally, given the increasing popularity and adoption of AI/ML-based approaches,\\nthe team has also begun exploring their potential.\\nThe goal of this work is to assess the performance of these approaches in the Hackensack Watershed,\\nalong with investigating the sensitivity of the model to various meteorological forcings, including forcings based on the National Water Model.\\n*(The initial and/or boundary conditions for all the models were determined using the Global Forecast System.)*\\n\\nThis investigation required handling a large volume of precipitation data from various models,\\neach with different spatial resolutions and in some cases, such as MPAS, using unstructured grids.\\nAs such, one of the key challenges was finding a hydrological modeling framework flexible enough to accommodate such diversity.\\nThis made the NextGen framework a natural choice, allowing them to integrate precipitation forcings from various sources\\nwith the appropriate pre-processing to align them with the model requirements in terms of spatial and temporal scales.\\n\\nThe complex implementation and execution of these models was faciliated by NextGen In A Box (NGIAB),\\nwhich successfully enabled the integration of diverse precipitation sources.\\nBy simplifying local deployment and providing full control over model inputs, configurations, and runtime operations,\\nNGIAB has given the I-SMART team the tools to conduct their groundbreaking research with even greater efficiency."},{"id":"devcon25-infra","metadata":{"permalink":"/local/blog/devcon25-infra","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-04-DevCon25-Infra.mdx","title":"DevCon 2025: A DevOps and Cyberinfrastructure

I had the privilege of delivering three oral presentations that showcase the use-inspired science outcomes emerging from the CIROH Science and Technology Team and our partners.\\n\\n#### [1. Advancing Hydrologic Modeling through Community-Driven Development: The NextGen Framework](https://github.com/CIROH-UA)\\n\\nThis [presentation](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1583570&rnd=0.1763265&mode=presInfo) introduced the Community NextGen initiative, a collaborative effort aimed at fostering open innovation and accelerating the framework\'s development. These efforts aim to facilitate efficient research-to-operations (R2O) and operations-to-research (O2R) transitions, ultimately enhancing our ability to model and predict water resources at various scales.\\n\\n#### [2. Enhancing Catchment Based Hydrological Model Performance through Dynamic Sub-Discretization Using Land Surface Attributes](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1583638&mode=presInfo)\\n\\nThis talk addressed how the simplifications in lumped models can lead to reduced accuracy when applied uniformly in catchments with significant land-surface heterogeneity. The study explores the potential to enhance lumped model performance by introducing dynamic discretization based on key land-surface heterogeneities such as land use, soil type and soil layering, slope aspect, and elevation.\\n\\n#### [3. Multi-model Predictions of Design Low Flow Conditions in the Great Salt Lake Basin Using NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1603025&rnd=0.5338731&mode=presInfo)\\n\\nThis research focused on the challenge of accurately estimating low flow conditions in ungauged basins, such as those in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) region. The study paves the way to investigate how different models perform in predicting design low flow, a critical standard for water supply planning, management, and ensuring water quality in the GSL basin at both gauged and ungauged locations.\\n\\nThese works directly reflects the ongoing efforts and use-inspired science outcomes of the\xa0[CIROH\xa0Science and Technology Team and Partners across the consortium](https://ngiab.ciroh.org/#:~:text=Alabama-,Water,-Institute). The congress served as a successful platform for showcasing these advancements and CIROH\'s leadership in community-driven, next-generation water resource prediction.\\n\\n![A speaker presents at the World Environmental & Water Resources Congress, with a large screen displaying presentation details and a \'Say Cheese\' graphic with a QR code.](/img/blog/2025-06-ewri-devcon/EWRI-Koriche_MD.png)"},{"id":"may-2025-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/local/blog/may-2025-update","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-16-HBV2.0.mdx","title":"\u03B4HBV2.0: How NGIAB and Wukong HPC Streamlined Advanced Hydrologic Modeling","description":"Here\'s how NGIAB and Wukong HPC enabled researchers at Pennsylvania State University to create advanced models!","date":"2025-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"CIROH","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ciroh"},{"inline":true,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":true,"label":"Community Spotlight","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/community-spotlight"},{"inline":true,"label":"Pennsylvania State University","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/pennsylvania-state-university"},{"inline":true,"label":"Monthly Update","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/monthly-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"Wukong","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/wukong"},{"inline":true,"label":"HPC","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/hpc"},{"inline":true,"label":"NGIAB","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ngiab"},{"inline":true,"label":"National Water Model","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/national-water-model"},{"inline":true,"label":"On-Premises Services","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/on-premises-services"},{"inline":true,"label":"Cloud Services","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/cloud-services"},{"inline":true,"label":"AI and Machine Learning","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ai-and-machine-learning"}],"readingTime":1.4,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Yalan Song","title":"Research Assistant Professor","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yalan-song-psu/","imageURL":"https://ca.slack-edge.com/T03UUB7CE83-U0583PXP58U-02e6df150857-192","key":"yalan","page":null},{"name":"Leo Lonzarich","title":"Graduate Researcher","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoglonz","imageURL":"https://ca.slack-edge.com/T03UUB7CE83-U075PFL5NUE-150fbf871a79-512","key":"leo","page":null},{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita","page":null},{"name":"James Halgren","title":"Assistant Director of Science","url":"https://github.com/jameshalgren","imageURL":"https://ca.slack-edge.com/T03UUB7CE83-U03UDT3AMST-4a6c980b793d-512","key":"james","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\u03B4HBV2.0: How NGIAB and Wukong HPC Streamlined Advanced Hydrologic Modeling","description":"Here\'s how NGIAB and Wukong HPC enabled researchers at Pennsylvania State University to create advanced models!","slug":"may-2025-update","authors":["yalan","leo","arpita","james"],"tags":["CIROH","Blog","Community Spotlight","Pennsylvania State University","Monthly Update","Wukong","HPC","NGIAB","National Water Model","On-Premises Services","Cloud Services","AI and Machine Learning"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/blog/2025-05-hbv/img.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Application of NOAA-OWP\'s NextGen Framework: DevCon 2025 and EWRI Congress 2025 Highlights","permalink":"/local/blog/ewri-devcon25-ngiab"},"nextItem":{"title":"Google Cloud Next 2025: Innovation at Scale \u2728","permalink":"/local/blog/april-2025-update"}},"content":"![Image of graphical outputs from the \u03B4HBV2.0 model](/img/blog/2025-05-hbv/img.jpg)\\n\\nPredicting water flow with precision across the vast U.S. landscape is a complex challenge. That\'s why Song et al. 2024 developed \u03B4HBV2.0, a cutting-edge hydrologic model. It\u2019s built with high-resolution modeling of physics to deliver seamless, highly accurate streamflow simulations, even down to individual sub-basins. It\'s already proven to be a major improvement, performing better than older tools at about 4,000 measurement sites. We also provide a comprehensive 40-year water dataset for ~180,000 river reaches to support this.\\n\\nPenn State research group pushed \u03B4HBV2.0 further, training it with even more detailed river data and integrating other trusted models, aiming to make it a key part of the NextGen national water modeling system (as a potential NWM3.0 successor). But here\u2019s a common hurdle: making powerful scientific tools like this easy and reliable for everyone to use within a larger framework can be tough. Setup issues, runtime errors, and inconsistent results can frustrate users.\\n\\nNGIAB stepped in to solve exactly this problem. Team has taken the complexity out of using the operations-ready models within NextGen by creating one unified, reliable package. Thanks to NGIAB, users don\'t have to worry about tricky setups or whether the model will run correctly. NGIAB ensures that our models are compatible everywhere and, most importantly, that they run exactly as designed, consistently and faithfully, every single time, no babysitting required. This means users get the full power of our advanced modeling, without the headaches.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## \uD83D\uDD17 Learn more\\n\\n\u03B4HBV2.0: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14827983\\n\\nSong et al. 2024: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024WR038928\\n\\nDataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13774373"},{"id":"april-2025-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/local/blog/april-2025-update","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-15-GoogleCloudNext.mdx","title":"Google Cloud Next 2025: Innovation at Scale \u2728","description":"Google Cloud Next 2025","date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Blog","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/blog"},{"inline":true,"label":"Conference","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/conference"},{"inline":true,"label":"Google Cloud","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/google-cloud"},{"inline":true,"label":"Google Cloud Next","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/google-cloud-next"},{"inline":true,"label":"AI and Machine Learning","permalink":"/local/blog/tags/ai-and-machine-learning"}],"readingTime":4.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Patel","title":"DevOps Manager and Enterprise Architect","url":"https://github.com/arpita0911patel","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54657?v=4","key":"arpita","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Google Cloud Next 2025: Innovation at Scale \u2728","description":"Google Cloud Next 2025","slug":"april-2025-update","authors":["arpita"],"tags":["Blog","Conference","Google Cloud","Google Cloud Next","AI and Machine Learning"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"img/blog/2025-04-gcp/gcp-1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u03B4HBV2.0: How NGIAB and Wukong HPC Streamlined Advanced Hydrologic Modeling","permalink":"/local/blog/may-2025-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"\uD83C\uDF1F UA\'s Alabama Water Institute Showcases 30-Minute Hydrological Modeling Revolution\uD83C\uDF1F","permalink":"/local/blog/march-2025-update"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\"\\nimport { Carousel } from \\"react-responsive-carousel\\"\\n\\n\\nLast week at Google Cloud Next representing our CIROH cloud-based computing efforts!

This software allows users to run NextGen in an efficient, relatively painless, and reproducible fashion, increasing community access to the NextGen framework. ngen-datastream is already community accessible (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main) and making an impact on research.  A major component of this software is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based research datastream (https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/research_datastream). The research datastream is a CONUS-wide recurring NextGen simulation configured by the community. The terraform to build the AWS infrastructure exists in the ngen-datastream repository and current development focuses on CI/CD and enabling community contribution to the research datastream via edits to the NextGen configuration. Ultimately, these tools help distribute access throughout the community to cutting edge hydrologic research, maximizing the pace of progress of research to operations in hydrology.\\n\\n### Contribution to CIROH: \\n\\n- **Automation**: It automates the process of collecting, formatting, and validating input data for NextGen, streamlining model preparation.\\n- **Flexibility**: It allows users to provide their own input files to run NextGen.\\n- **Scalable Infrastructure**: It utilizes AWS state machine to provide access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources.\\n\\n\\n### Infrastructure Utilized: \\n\\n- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**\\n- **Simple Storage Service (S3)** \\n- **AWS Lamda and Step Functions**\\n\\n\\n## 2.

NextGen is a cutting-edge hydrologic modeling framework that aims to advance the science and practice of hydrology and water resources management. In this month\'s blog, we will highlight some of the recent achievements and developments of the Community NextGen team.\\n{/* truncate */}\\nFirst, we are excited to announce that NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) is now available with Singularity support. This means that you can run NGIAB on any HPC system that does not support Docker, using Singularity containers. Singularity is a popular tool for creating and running portable and reproducible computational environments. To learn how to use NGIAB with Singularity, please visit our GitHub repository: [Ngen-Singularity](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/Ngen-Singularity).\\n\\nSecond, we have made several improvements and enhancements to NGIAB, such as updating the sample input data, upgrading the Boost library, adding auto mode run, and supporting geopackage format. You can find more details about these updates on our GitHub repository: [NGIAB-CloudInfra](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra).\\n\\nThird, we would like to share with you is the development of NextGen Datastream, a tool that automates the process of collecting and formatting input data for NextGen, orchestrating the NextGen run through NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), and handling outputs. The NextGen Datastream is a shell script that orchestrates each step in the process, using a configuration file that specifies the data sources, parameters, and options for the NextGen run. The NextGen Datastream can also generate its own internal configs and modify the configuration file as needed. You can find more details and instructions on how to use the NextGen Datastream on our GitHub repository: [ngen-datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/README.md).\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this blog and found it informative and useful. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please feel free to contact us at ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu. Thank you for your interest and support in the Community NextGen project.
