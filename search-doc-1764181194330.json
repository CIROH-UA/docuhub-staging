Between extensive code reviews, model refactoring, and validation runs, we verified δHBV 2.0's operations-ready performance through its Basic Model Interface (BMI) within the NextGen runtime, ensuring full compliance with BMI standards and alignment with previously published benchmarks. We enhanced the model to support both batch and sequential timestep simulations — the latter mirroring the runtime behavior of NextGen — while maintaining high computational efficiency and reproducibility across environments.  Once δHBV 2.0 was verified and tuned, we expanded the scope to broader ecosystem integration. The model was finalized on GitHub with modular configuration capabilities, daily and hourly (model coming soon) simulation modes, and confirmed compatibility with the T-route routing component. Significant performance optimizations were implemented to improve scalability across large basin networks. We added δHBV 2.0 support to the NGIAB distribution, enabling cloud-based state loading from AWS S3 (PR coming soon), and extended its reach into the NGIAB Data Preprocess to allow on-demand generation of forcings, static catchment attributes, and model realizations for NextGen. Finally, the static catchment attributes were incorporated into the CIROH Community Hydrofabric, ensuring the model is represented and interoperable within the hydrologic framework used across the consortium.  The beauty of these efforts lies in the fact that δHBV 2.0 is built upon a model-agnostic, differentiable modeling framework — δMG. Therefore, the formalization accomplished during this visit scales to all new research products and advancements made through the framework, streamlining future NGIAB and NRDS integrations and reducing development overhead across projects.

In one such case, Leo and the team toured the University of Alabama's data center, meeting with Josh Lotfi and other members of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) who help manage CIROH's on-premises high-performance computing resources. Naturally, this included 1-on-1 time with the flashing lights and silicon of Wukong (which supports a bulk of Penn State's R&amp;D) and Pantarhei HPCs. Across the board, these interactions gave valuable insight into work going on behind the scenes at AWI and about how CIROH's cyberinfrastructure supports researchers and partners across academia, government, and industry.  It is easy to see these collaborations as purely technical exchanges.

We anticipate continuing this AWI-Penn State collaboration, with future projects e.g., being additions to NGIAB and NRDS including more differentiable models, a formal hourly δHBV 2.0 model, and differentiable routing. Some of this work may also arrive in a DevCon to showcase the efforts of both of groups.  Overall, this visit exemplifies how CIROH's approach to developing a community of practice catalyzes scientific advancements, fosters lasting inter-institutional relationships, and makes normally lab-bound research products salient to the broader R2O community. In these collaborations, CIROH's core mission, strengthening the link between scientific discovery and operational forecasting, remains clear and in view.

A corrected reach arising from the UA-USU collaboration. Recent collaboration between researchers in the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) from University of Alabama (UA) and Utah State University (USU) highlighted the value of cross-institutional partnerships in improving community hydrologic modeling. Focused on the Logan River watershed, this joint effort demonstrated how sharing tools, knowledge, and infrastructure can accelerate both model development and scientific discovery. Through this engagement, USU researchers gained deeper understanding of the NextGen framework and T-Route modeling library, empowering them to improve physical process representations for the Logan River watershed for heightened simulation fidelity. The collaboration also provided valuable exposure to the developmental side of complex modeling tools, offering insights into framework design, automation workflows, and best practices for model setup and calibration. Both teams benefited from exposure to alternative research tools and methods, which helped enhance and refine the community development pipeline. One key outcome was the correction of a spatial representation in the Logan River hydrofabric (Figure 1) using the USU’s specific local knowledge. The reach for this region (highlighted in the zoomed subfigure) was updated to reflect its real world path, where it flows into an underwater tunnel that reconnects to Logan River further downstream. This correction will be integrated into the community hydrofabric, benefiting the wider community by improving model realism and reliability. Furthermore, in combination with freshly calibrated model parameters, these updates have improved the model's KGE metric by 0.2 units — a significant gain in model accuracy. NGIAB played a central role in this success, streamlining the process of setting up, running, and analyzing multiple model configurations. By removing the typical installation and troubleshooting barriers, researchers could focus their time on advancing physical representations rather than infrastructure issues. This collaboration sets a precedent for how community-driven, open science efforts can improve hydrologic model performance and usability. By combining localized knowledge with shared national tools, we move closer to creating reliable, reusable, and scalable flood forecasting systems, a crucial step for Research-to-Operations (R2O) success. We look forward to repeating this model of collaboration with other regional experts and academic institutions to continually refine the National Water Model ecosystem and its supporting frameworks.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"CIROH Research CyberInfrastructure Update","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docuhub-staging/blog/July Monthly IT Update","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Cloud Infrastructure​","type":1,"pageTitle":"CIROH Research CyberInfrastructure Update","url":"/docuhub-staging/blog/July Monthly IT Update#cloud-infrastructure","content":" CIROH's Google Cloud Account is now fully operational and managed by our team.

The densely populated Hackensack River watershed lies within the New York City Metropolitan Area, which spans northern New Jersey and southern New York. Accurate streamflow forecasting within this region is therefore essential to enable effective water resource management, flood prediction, and disaster preparedness. Precipitation data is critical for effective hydrological modeling, making the identification of reliable data sources a key priority. This is why the Integrated Spatial Modeling and Remote Sensing Technologies Laboratory (I-SMART), an interdisciplinary research unit within the Davidson Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, uses the latest developments in both atmospheric and hydrological modeling to address flood risks in the Hackensack Watershed with solutions that could be expanded to the entire New York City Metropolitan Area. In the past, this work has included key early applications of the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen). Notably, the I-SMART group was among the first to force the NextGen framework with multiple atmospheric models for comparative analysis during a real-world event: the passage of Superstorm Ida over the New York metropolitan area in September 2021. The recent advent of NextGen In a Box (NGIAB) has provided an opportunity to accelerate these applications even further by taking full advantage of NGIAB's containerized, user-friendly, and easily deployed environment. Recently, the I-SMART team has been testing various regional atmospheric models grounded in physical equations, including traditional models like WRF and next-generation atmospheric models such as MPAS. Additionally, given the increasing popularity and adoption of AI/ML-based approaches, the team has also begun exploring their potential. The goal of this work is to assess the performance of these approaches in the Hackensack Watershed, along with investigating the sensitivity of the model to various meteorological forcings, including forcings based on the National Water Model.(The initial and/or boundary conditions for all the models were determined using the Global Forecast System.) This investigation required handling a large volume of precipitation data from various models, each with different spatial resolutions and in some cases, such as MPAS, using unstructured grids. As such, one of the key challenges was finding a hydrological modeling framework flexible enough to accommodate such diversity. This made the NextGen framework a natural choice, allowing them to integrate precipitation forcings from various sources with the appropriate pre-processing to align them with the model requirements in terms of spatial and temporal scales. The complex implementation and execution of these models was faciliated by NextGen In A Box (NGIAB), which successfully enabled the integration of diverse precipitation sources. By simplifying local deployment and providing full control over model inputs, configurations, and runtime operations, NGIAB has given the I-SMART team the tools to conduct their groundbreaking research with even greater efficiency.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"🌍 AWI News​","type":1,"pageTitle":"🌟 UA's Alabama Water Institute Showcases 30-Minute Hydrological Modeling Revolution🌟","url":"/docuhub-staging/blog/march-2025-update#-awi-news","content":" The Alabama Water Institute (AWI) at the University of Alabama (UA) recently published an article highlighting how NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) could transform hydrological modeling.

The plane landed around 9:30 p.m., but with no dinner on board, the drive from Birmingham to Tuscaloosa became an unexpectedly comprehensive tour of places that were neither open nor in possession of a single vegetable. The group checked into the Indigo just before midnight, somewhat hungry but otherwise intact.  After Team Calgary’s epic late-night journey, we kicked off early on Monday morning with a whiteboard session to map out the “assets” we rely on for hydrologic modeling—datasets, models, tools—everything from the CAMELS dataset to TOPMODEL to NOAH-OWP-Modular, plus the assortment of geospatial processing and calibration methods that we all depend on. The aim was to start corralling this sprawling collection of community resources into something a bit more coherent, mostly because no single group has the expertise (or the workforce) needed to tackle all the challenges of building state-of-the-art prediction systems. The conversation naturally focused on software integration—the whole point of the trip—as we tried to figure out how to get these pieces to play nicely with each other.  A high point of the morning was meeting with our operational colleagues at the NOAA Office of Water Prediction—Dr. Fred Ogden, Dr. Fernando Salas, and Dr. Jason Regina. They shared updates on OWP’s vision for future versions of the National Water Model and outlined plans for defining model configurations and calibratng them across the national domain.  Refueled by a terrific lunch at the Curry Kitchen, we reconvened to focus on two key integration efforts: introducing the SYMFLUENCE integration architecture for large-domain modeling and enabling SUMMA’s process-based simulations to run seamlessly within the NextGen workflow.  Darri Eythorsson walked the group through SYMFLUENCE, an integration architecture designed to make hydrologic modeling workflows more structured and efficient, describing how SYMFLUENCE supports everything from defining spatial domains and preparing data to model setup, calibration, optimization, and evaluation. He emphasized that SYMFLUENCE can also drive simulations from NextGen, giving NextGen access to capabilities such as large-sample calibration and geospatial preprocessing. Darri noted that the system runs on laptops, HPC clusters, and cloud-compute platforms, making it adaptable to modeling at different scales.  We closed out Monday with a deep dive into bringing SUMMA into NOAA/OWP’s NextGen framework. The meeting was scheduled late in the day so that Ashley van Beusekom, one of SUMMA’s primary developers, could join from her home in Okinawa, Japan. A couple of years ago, Ashley added BMI support to SUMMA, making it possible to run the model within the NextGen architecture. Ahead of the meeting, she and Darri Eythorsson worked together to set up SUMMA as a spatially distributed model in NextGen, and they successfully reproduced the Provo and Oyster River test cases to verify that everything was running as intended. Quinn and Josh from AWI were excited by the results and immediately started weaving SUMMA capabilities into the broader NextGen framework.  The U Calgary crew wrapped up the day on the Indigo Hotel rooftop, sharing giant pretzels, vegetables, and the warm Alabama night air. They toasted the momentum of the visit and the possibilities ahead. As the night settled in, Team RTI’s Matt Denno and Sam Lamont arrived mid-evening Monday, ready to jump into the work the next morning.  ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Technical deep dives​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Moving Hydrologic Prediction Forward — A software integration meeting at the Alabama Water Institute","url":"/docuhub-staging/blog/software-integration-meeting#technical-deep-dives","content":" The RTI and U Calgary teams met up for breakfast on Tuesday morning at Heritage House where they exchanged high-fives and consumed the caffeine and carbohydrates needed to tackle another ambitious day of software integration.  Once everyone settled in at AWI, the group dug into the two main challenges of the week: integrating models into the NextGen framework (the U Calgary effort) and evaluating those simulations with shared protocols (the RTI focus). The conversation broadened as Arpita Patel (UA), Jordan Laser (Lynker), Zach Wills (Lynker), Nels Frazier (Lynker), Giovanni Romero (Aquaveo), Jonathan Frame (UA), Trupesh Patel (UA), Harsha Vemula (UA) and Manjila Singh (UA) joined to discuss their work on making NextGen accessible and useful to the wider community. Together, the group reviewed progress on SYMFLUENCE, the NextGen/SUMMA integration, and the TEEHR data model. As always, James Halgren kept everything running seamlessly, turning lunch into a productive working session so the team could update the University of Alabama’s computer science leads on recent advances and ongoing challenges.  Before long, the team divided into smaller groups so they could move quickly on the most pressing software-integration tasks on the schedule. Throughout the day, the big question hovered: How do we create a seamless pipeline from model execution data ingest→ evaluation → model improvement?  On the RTI side, much of the effort focused on preparing outputs for seamless use within the TEEHR Evaluation System. This involved translating the output from NextGen simulations into the TEEHR data schema and determining how best to extract the metadata needed to track which model configuration produced each forecast. The team also worked on defining crosswalks to link simulation points to USGS gage IDs, ensuring that model results could be cleanly tied back to the appropriate metadata and hydrofabric, and they began documenting key operational details such as run intervals and latency characteristics of near-real-time runs. By the time the dust settled, the RTI and AWI teams had stitched the pieces together and emerged with the gratifying sense that they had made good initial progress on the problem they came to solve.  On the U Calgary side, the team split off into two groups. In one corner Darri Eythorsson and Cyril Thebault met with Josh Cunningham to make progress on integrating SUMMA in to NextGen. There were lots of issues to consider, including appropriately linking with different software libraries and ensuring that SUMMA could run effectively in the containerized NextGen instantiation “NextGen In a Box” (NGIAB). The software integration progress was rapid, thanks in large part to the Herculean efforts of Ashley van Beusekom prior to the visit.  In another corner, Martyn Clark sat down with James Halgren and Quinn Lee to put together a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for the AWI-led efforts to transition CIROH research into NOAA/OWP operations. The timing mattered: James was preparing to drive to Utah the following week for a faculty position at Brigham Young University, and leadership of his group was in the process of transitioning to Quinn Lee and Josh Cunningham. The SWOT analysis brought a sense of optimism and excitement as the team saw the promise in recent hydrologic prediction advances and brainstormed several clear steps to make the research-to-operations path smoother and more effective.  Later in the day, Arpita Patel and Matt Denno met with NOAA/OWP Chief Scientist Fred Ogden to walk through the latest NextGen Framework design diagram and discuss how their development of NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) aligns with NOAA/OWP’s component-based architecture. Their conversation highlighted that NGIAB already follows many of these principles, including modular components, stand-alone tools, and fully BMI-compliant model execution. They also identified clear opportunities to strengthen the alignment, particularly around refining the runtime environment, enhancing component decoupling, and mapping NGIAB’s architecture onto OWP’s emerging design. The meeting set the stage for ongoing coordination.  Dinner at the River Café was a highlight of the day. With a table on the terrace and the Black Warrior River drifting by below, the team enjoyed an evening of easy conversation and good-natured reflection on the progress over the past two days.

RTI paired with AWI software engineers to advance the TEEHR model evaluation manager, tightening the evaluation protocols, metadata requirements, and workflow linkages needed for basin-scale and national-scale verification. U Calgary spent the day with CIROH leadership —Steve Burian, Sagy Cohen, and Erin White—reviewing their major research advances and the steps required to improve the research-to-operations pipeline. A clear highlight of the day came when SUMMA was successfully integrated into NextGen: Martyn Clark marked the moment with a celebratory dance—hands clasped, fingers interlocked, and his upper body swaying with unmistakable satisfaction.  That evening, everyone gathered at Steve Burian’s home for a farewell celebration in honor of James Halgren. Steve and his wife Cindy laid out an extraordinary taco spread, enough to nourish the lively crowd that had gathered to see James off in style. James brought with him a tall stack of mounted photographs he had taken around the U.S., and he spent the night offering warm goodbyes and writing personal messages on the back of each one. It was a lovely gesture, and a reminder of how much his enthusiasm and kindness had meant to the community.  The joint visit wrapped up on Thursday morning, when the full team gathered to chart a path forward. Together they mapped out the key components of the NextGen Research Data Stream (NRDS—affectionately pronounced “nerds”) and clarified how NRDS fits within the broader NOAA/OWP NextGen framework, including the orchestration manager, calibration manager, and evaluation manager that had occupied so much attention throughout the week. The discussion concluded with a clear set of immediate priorities, identifying the specific steps needed over the next six months to realize near-term successes in the transition of research to operations.

The platforms developed by CIROH's DevOps team - the Research to Operations Hydrologic Community (R2OHC) platform and tools developed by CIROH's Science team, Lynker team, RTI team and Aquaveo team —including NextGen In A Box (NGIAB), NRDS, and containerized modeling environments—provide researchers with immediate access to computational resources and standardized workflows. By eliminating the traditional barriers of infrastructure setup and configuration, these platforms allow research teams like University of Calgary, RTI International, Lynker, Aquaveo and AWI to focus their energy on scientific innovation rather than technical implementation. This meeting at AWI represents the kind of rapid, collaborative progress that becomes possible when robust cyberinfrastructure removes technical friction from the research process.

It was a rewarding experience to learn about the Tethys Platform and how researchers, hydrologists, and geospatial scientists are applying it in their work. Through workshops and technical demonstrations, I gained insights into how this open-source Earth science platform is advancing environmental problem-solving.  On Day 1, I participated in the Tethys Dash workshop led by Corey Krewson, where I learned to build a Tethys dashboard without writing any code. During the hands-on session, I was surprised by how easily I was able to build dashboards using a drag-and-drop interface, as much of the technical implementation was abstracted for simplicity. I also attended the Tethys Component Apps (ReactPy) workshop by Shawn Crawley. Unlike the no-code approach of the first session, this workshop focused on building a basic interactive Tethys web app in under 50 lines of Python code.  On Day 2, I also took part in the Contributing to Tethys Core workshop led by Nathan Swain. This workshop outlined the steps for first-time contributors to get involved and submit pull requests to the Tethys Core repository. Aside from the workshops, I took part in Tethys App Competition where I presented the Tethys app I developed. It was a great learning experience to understand more about web app developments using Tethys. I ended up winning second place and got a bonsai tree LEGO set!  Overall, it was a very engaging and informative summit.

Built on Django, it bundles a full spatial stack (PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers/Cesium) plus handy &quot;Gizmos&quot; for maps, charts, and dashboards, and it integrates seamlessly with scientific libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, and Bokeh. A built-in job manager runs heavy climate or hydrologic models—locally or in the cloud—while APIs make it easy to pull data from THREDDS servers or PostGIS databases. The result is a low-barrier path to custom interfaces, 2D/3D visualizations, and scalable computing that's already powering water-resource tools, climate-scenario explorers, and disaster-monitoring apps worldwide. Backed by the Tethys Geoscience Foundation, the platform's active open-source community keeps it evolving to meet new Earth-science challenges.

Scientists around the world use it for a range of applications—water resource management, climate change analysis, natural disaster monitoring, environmental planning, and more. In each case, Tethys helps turn complex datasets and model outputs into accessible tools for decision-makers. As an open-source project under the Tethys Geoscience Foundation, it benefits from an active user community that continually contributes improvements and new features. This collaborative growth ensures the platform keeps pace with emerging needs in Earth science, effectively lowering the barrier for geoscientists to share data and models as powerful web applications.

The official documentation covers everything from installation and &quot;Hello World&quot; examples to advanced topics and architecture (explaining how the Django backend and various services fit together). For hands-on learning, the tutorials guide you through setting up your first app, incorporating spatial data with built-in map layouts, connecting to GeoServer or THREDDS data servers, and even running cloud computations. And if you want to see Tethys in action without installing anything, the Tethys Demo Portal showcases a gallery of live example apps, such as a Gizmo Showcase of interactive widgets and a Wildfire Visualizer that displays wildfire data on a map, giving you a clear idea of the platform's capabilities and inspiring ideas for your own geoscientific web applications.  Each of these resources will help you dive deeper into the Tethys Platform. Whether you're looking to develop a water resources tool, a climate data viewer, or any geoscientific web application, the combination of documentation, tutorials, and live demos will support you on your journey with Tethys.

We guide users to be able to compare the flood map from that model with the baseline flood map for the same area from NWM HAND using FIMServ tool developed by our CIROH partners in University of Alabama. The flowchart for the overall methodology for creating the database and using it for visualization is shown in Figure 4 and explained in detail in subsequent section.    Figure 4: Methodology  Step 1:  Re-run your flood model with as many flow values as you desire. A basic database model may include flood maps for flow values corresponding to return periods ranging from 2 years to 1000 years. If you are using the NWM flows, you can find the return period values using the NWM_returnperiod_finder_Tool tool developed at Hydroinformatics Lab, BYU. You will need to have NWM feature IDs for the streams in your domain. You can use NWM_FeatureID_finder_Tool to find the feature IDs for your domain. This code gives you the IDs along the mainstream path only.  Step 2:  Run the HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) model for your area of interest. Follow the following steps to generate flood maps using HAND method.  Generate the shape file of the model boundary from the model you have for your area of interest.Use the FimServe_Tool to create HAND-based flood maps by providing the same model boundary shapefile and the discharge values.This tool uses NWM (National Water Model) retrospective data by default to generate flood maps.To create flood maps for specific return periods, use return-period discharge values, instead of retrospective flow values, for each NWM reach ID using the tool mentioned in Step 1.Make sure the flood maps generated from your model and HAND model correspond to same discharge values if you want to make meaningful comparison.Clip the output maps with the model boundary shape file.  Step 3:  Extract all available flood maps generated from your hydraulic model and the HAND model. Flood maps may include:  Shapefiles of flood extentsDepth rastersWater surface elevation rastersVelocity rasters (if available)  Note: The HAND model generates only depth rasters, which can be converted to shapefiles using GIS tools.  Step 4:  Reproject all raster and vector files to EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).Ensure that the spatial extents of all files match, which is necessary for comparison in the FIM Visualization Application.You can use GIS software or python codes for reprojection and alignment.  Step 5:  Prepare input files for populating the database. Here is the list of input files that you need for creating and populating ONE database (corresponding to your area of interest).  Table 1 Required input files for creating FIM database.  S.N.\tGeneric File Name\tQuantity\tDescription1.\tFIM_input_data.csv\t1\tInsert details of the models that are to be used in FIM database 2.\tHuc8.csv\t1\tAssuming that the extent for all models is the same 3.\t{River}_{model}_flows.csv\t1 for each model type\tContains rating curve information for each model. Enter the file names of the raster and vector files that were generated in step 4. 4.\tFeature_ids_{model}.csv\t1 for each model type\tContains the list of NWM feature IDs for the area and their Lat, Long values  You can use these sample input files for your reference. Remember all the column headers should be exactly as they appear in these sample files.  Also, the name of the models in “software” column in FIM_input_data.csv file should match with the ones as shown in Table 2.  Table 2 The list of software names currently included in the database.  ModelTypeID\tSoftware0\tHEC-RAS 1D 1\tHEC-RAS 2D 2\tHEC-RAS 1D/2D Combo 3\tSRH-2D 4\tFIER 5\tAutoRoute 6\tHAND 7\tTRITON 8\tSatellite Observations 9\tSurveyed Flood Extents 10\tOthers  To get the HUC8 number for the area, use the latter part of NWM_FeatureID_finder_Tool.

This involves the ordered execution of modules designed to simulate individual processes or fluxes and the integration of these over time on various control volumes to simulate the temporal evolution of model states. These are referred to as &quot;multi-BMI&quot; formulations.  Currently, the order of execution of modules within a multi-BMI model formulation is determined by the ordering of modules in the run realization file. This presentation showcases model/module developments undertaken to date in this regard and discusses knowledge gaps and needs. Additionally, it proposes potential coding standards for modules that allow for the monitoring of conservation law enforcement at the framework level for different model formulations using various internal discretizations.

The NextGen Framework aims to resolve current limitations of the National Water Model by transitioning to a highly modular, model-agnostic framework that improves regional interoperability and by making it easier for the hydrology community to append their own models. To enable these tenets, NextGen uses the Basic Model Interface (BMI) to standardize the format of each model's input, output, and properties, thus allowing for models written in any language to quickly be coupled together to create new outputs. These models are combined according to external configuration files, which ensures that all model runs are highly portable and reproducible.

While NGen is still under development, it's become an incredibly powerful tool for novel approaches to hydrology.  Unfortunately, these advantages are stymied somewhat by the difficulty of installing NGen. No standard installation process is currently available, instead requiring users to manage a lengthy chainof dependencies, compilers, and environmental conditions. This can already be a time-consuming task for experienced programmers, so for scientists wanting to apply it in their own research, installing and configuring NGen is severely unapproachable.

This allows for better cost allocation, resource identification, and easier filtering when managing resources across multiple accounts. Follow How to tag resources on AWS. Cost allocation: Allowed limit for new subaccount is $500/project per month. Monitor the usage throughout the month and if it reaches above $500/project, notify admin of the subaccount to take necessary actions. For projects expecting more than $500 per month usage, please email ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu in advance to get the approval from higher management. Effective Sept 2024, we transitioned to a new budgeting model (for existing users) that provides your CIROH AWS subaccount with a $10,000 budget for every 6-month period and monthly max limit of $3000. This change will give you more flexibility to plan and execute your research workloads without the constraints of a monthly cap. Resource quotas: Set resource quotas for subaccounts to limit their spending and resource usage. This helps prevent accidental overspending and ensures efficient resource allocation. Monitor resource usage: Encourage subaccount admins to monitor their resource usage regularly to identify potential cost optimization opportunities. Data Locality: Always consider the location of your data when selecting a region for deploying resources. Deploying resources in the same region as your data minimizes data transfer costs and latency, leading to improved performance and cost-efficiency. Region Selection: Carefully evaluate the available AWS regions and select the one that best aligns with your data residency requirements, compliance needs, and desired performance characteristics.  EBS:  EBS Volume Management: Avoiding Unnecessary Costs: Terminate EBS Volumes with Terminated Instances: When terminating an EC2 instance, ensure that you also delete any associated EBS volumes that are no longer needed. EBS volumes incur charges even if they are not attached to a running instance. Regularly Review EBS Volume Usage: Periodically review your EBS volumes using the EC2 Management Console or AWS CLI. Identify any unattached volumes that are no longer required and delete them to avoid ongoing charges.  EFS:  Data Lifecycle Management: Evaluate your data access patterns. For infrequently accessed files, consider migrating data from Amazon EFS to Amazon S3 to leverage its cost-efficient storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier. Tiered Storage Strategy: Implement a tiered storage strategy where frequently accessed data resides on EFS for high performance, while infrequently accessed or archival data is moved to S3 for cost-effective long-term storage.

Utilizing Slurm, a user initiates a request for resources and submits a job to a designated queue. Subsequently, the system undertakes the task of extracting jobs from the queues, assigning the requisite compute nodes, and executing the submitted tasks. Although users typically access the Slurm job scheduler by SSH-ing to a Pantarhei login node, it is imperative to emphasize that the recommended practice entails utilizing Slurm to submit work as a job, as opposed to executing computationally intensive tasks directly on a login node. Given that all users share the login nodes, running anything beyond minimal test jobs can adversely affect the collective ability of users to effectively utilize Pantarhei resources. Pantarhei's framework is tailored to accommodate the moderate-scale computational and data requirements of the majority of CIROH users. Users with allocations possess the capability to submit tasks to a diverse array of queues, each featuring distinct job size and walltime constraints. Dedicated sets of queues are allocated for CPU, GPU, and FPGA nodes, with typically shorter walltime and smaller job size limits translating to expedited turnaround times. Several additional considerations regarding Pantarhei queues merit attention: Pantarhei facilitates shared jobs, whereby multiple tasks can be executed on a single node. This approach enhances job throughput, maximizes overall system utilization, and fosters increased user accessibility to Pantarhei resources.Pantarhei accommodates long-running jobs, with run times extendable up to seven days for tasks utilizing up to 6 full nodes.The maximum permissible job size on Pantarhei is 240 cores. For tasks exceeding this threshold, users are advised to initiate a consulting ticket to engage in further discussion with Pantarhei support personnel.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Running Jobs","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Pantarhei/RunningJobs/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Navigational Resources​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Running Jobs","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Pantarhei/RunningJobs/#navigational-resources","content":"   📄️ Accessing the Compute Nodes Accessing compute notes in Pantarhei ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Wukong","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Wukong/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Navigational Resources​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Wukong","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Wukong/#navigational-resources","content":"   📄️ System Architecture System Architecture of Wukong 📄️ Obtaining an Account Obtain an account on Wukong 📄️ Accessing the System Access of On-Premises Cluster Wukong ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Hardware Specifications","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Pantarhei/sysinfo","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Network​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Hardware Specifications","url":"/docuhub-staging/docs/services/on-prem/Pantarhei/sysinfo#network","content":" All nodes are interconnected by a Mellanox InfiniBand switch with FDR 56 Gb/s networks.
